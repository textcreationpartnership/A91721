            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the ChriÅ¿tian READER.</head>
            <p>SEeing it hath pleaÅ¿ed Almighty God, to bring this good diÅ¿courÅ¿e to thy Å¿ight; We are certain waÅ¿t thou Å¿enÅ¿ible of thy benefit that might redound to thy Å¿oul upon the Imbracing of the Doctrine therein contained, thou wouldÅ¿t not look upon it, as men now a dayes look upon moÅ¿t Books, with a careleÅ¿Å¿e unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olved reÅ¿olution, to embrace what Å¿hall appear to them to be truth; but rather to pleaÅ¿e their curious fancy, then nouriÅ¿h and refreÅ¿h their Å¿ouls with good and wholÅ¿ome Doctrine, the effects whereof would bring them to happineÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>We wilt not here make it our work to plead for the excellency of this DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, but leave that to the Book it Å¿elf. Only our advice to thee is that (Å¿eeing the things that are therein aÅ¿Å¿erted, are built upon plain texts of Scripture, without any conÅ¿equencies; and Å¿eeing its tendancy is Å¿o much to the propagating of holineÅ¿Å¿e (without which no man Å¿hall Å¿ee God) and likewiÅ¿e that it is not the opinion of a particular man onely, but of Å¿everall Churches of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t)
<pb facs="tcp:113294:4"/> thou wouldÅ¿t give the more heed to what thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿t. Obtain the honour to be like the Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> by Å¿earching in the Scripture, whether the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein be Å¿o or not; beg of God, that he would illuminate thy underÅ¿tanding, in Å¿eaching after the truth, and having Å¿ound it, Å¿ear not to own it; God will Å¿tand by thoÅ¿e that Å¿tand for him, and if he be on thy Å¿ide it's no matter who is against thee; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beg of God more and more to confirm thee in the truth, and ingage him to make thee yet more wiÅ¿e, by improving the wiÅ¿dome thou hast already obtained.</p>
            <p>ConÅ¿ider how all along the truth (or at least that which was moÅ¿t true) hath been cryed out against and perÅ¿ecuted under the notion of Error. How was our Lord JeÅ¿us Christ himÅ¿elf lookt upon, as a blaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheamer? Yea, and put to death on that accompt; neither hath the malice of men, reÅ¿ted in crucifying their Lord, but hath extended much farther, even to the killing his ApoÅ¿tles, Prophets and DiÅ¿ciples, and all upon the Å¿ame Å¿core of blaÅ¿phemy and Errour.</p>
            <p>What is it that keeps Mahomets Religion in Turkey alive, but that it is death to diÅ¿pute it? And what keeps the Popes intereÅ¿t up in <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, but inquiÅ¿itians and Tortures, which are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on thoÅ¿e who deny his Å¿upremacy, and argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Religion? And what is it that will keep <hi>England</hi> from ever having the knowledge of the truth flouriÅ¿h within its Dominion and Terri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:113294:4"/> we muÅ¿t enter into the kingdom of God; they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alter their Religion from EpiÅ¿copacy to Presbytery and to EpiÅ¿copacy (or any other Religion that the state and the generality of men are of) again (Å¿o they may live at eaÅ¿e and have their bodies well pampered) then be a diÅ¿ciple of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t upon Å¿uch tearms: yea, and rather then they will enter into the kingdom of God through tribulation, or perÅ¿ecution; they will maintain Å¿uch a Doctrine, and Å¿tand up for Å¿uch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; the profeÅ¿Å¿ion whereof Å¿hall never expoÅ¿e them to Å¿ufferings for it: Yea and if they cannot maintain it by Scripture or reaÅ¿on, they will (as much as in them lies) procure the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the civil MagiÅ¿trate to enforce it upon the people, though it be against their conÅ¿ciences: Which if we did but well conÅ¿ider, is a Å¿ufficient argument to evince the falÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it being Å¿o unlike to the Religion of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his Apostles, of whom we never read that they deÅ¿ired the civill MagiÅ¿trate to protect them, or to establiÅ¿h their Religion by force upon the people, for that indeed is but (as beÅ¿t) the way to make men hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, in that the moÅ¿t of men will rather imbrace a Religion against their conÅ¿ciences, then Å¿uffer any thing for religion.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Hath there not been Å¿ome doubt amongÅ¿t the Ancients touching Å¿ome of theÅ¿e Authors?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, but inaÅ¿much as they could alledge no juÅ¿t ground of doubting, the doubt utterly vaniÅ¿hed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But how is it that the Å¿econd cauÅ¿e hath here no place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> An Author is deemed to be of Å¿uÅ¿pected cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, if he have not exact cogniÅ¿ance of the thing which he deÅ¿cribeth, or deÅ¿cribeth it otherwiÅ¿e then he knoweth the thing to be: or finally, if there be Å¿ome hints therof in the very writing it Å¿elf; but no Å¿uch thing can be detected in thoÅ¿e Authors, as you Å¿hall in particular underÅ¿tand.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Why cannot the firÅ¿t be here diÅ¿covered?</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:113294:6"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> BecauÅ¿e no Å¿uÅ¿pition can poÅ¿Å¿ibly creep into the mind concerning thoÅ¿e Authors, as if they had not had exact cognizance of the thing which they deÅ¿cribed, in that Å¿ome of them were eye and ear-witneÅ¿Å¿es of the things which they Å¿et down, and the others were fully and accurately informed by them concerning the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Why cannot the Å¿econd?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> InaÅ¿much as the ChriÅ¿tian Religion doth prohibit lying, even in the Å¿malleÅ¿t matter, it is clear that thoÅ¿e Authors, who were not only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tians, but alÅ¿o the firÅ¿t Doctors of the ChriÅ¿tian Religion, could by no means lye, eÅ¿pecially in a thing of Å¿uch importance, as would draw the whole world into error.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Why cannot the third?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e in theÅ¿e books there is no repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no falÅ¿ity, as by an accurate diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ion of all the places which Å¿eem to make Å¿hew of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, might eaÅ¿ily be made to appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You have Å¿hown how two cauÅ¿es of the four have here no place, Å¿hew alÅ¿o why the third cannot be admitted?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> If the third cauÅ¿e had here any place, it muÅ¿t be either that thoÅ¿e writings have been wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or in part. They could not be wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, for then neither would thoÅ¿e be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them, whom we a little before proved to have been the Authors. But if they were corrupted in part, certainly it would either be in thoÅ¿e things that are of great moment, or in thoÅ¿e that are of Å¿mall moment. Not in thoÅ¿e things that are of great moment, inaÅ¿much as the corrupted part would betray it Å¿elf, by being unÅ¿uitable to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted ones. But if there be any corruption in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113294:7"/> Å¿ome things of Å¿light moment, that neither is nor ought to be of Å¿o great weight, as to render the credit of the Books Å¿uÅ¿pected.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Can you not alÅ¿o prove another way, that the writings of the new Covenant have not been corrupted?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, for it is altogether incredible that God, whoÅ¿e goodneÅ¿Å¿e and providence are immenÅ¿e, hath Å¿uffered thoÅ¿e writings, wherein he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed his Will, and the way to eternal life, and which through the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿o many ages, have by all the godly been received and approved as Å¿uch, to be any wayes corrupted.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How will you prove that the fourth cauÅ¿e hath here no place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You might of your Å¿elf have obÅ¿erved that already, in that there are no fit and Å¿ufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timonies of credit-worthy men, wherewith thoÅ¿e writings may be preÅ¿Å¿ed or oppugned.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> InaÅ¿much as you have taught that there is no cauÅ¿e why it Å¿hould be doubted concerning the writings of the new Covenant, teach likewiÅ¿e why credence Å¿hould be given to the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Although this very thing, namely, that there is no juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>o doubt of them, afford a Å¿trong argument why credence Å¿hould be given to them, yet will I alledge a moÅ¿t weighty conÅ¿ideration to win your aÅ¿Å¿ent.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What may that conÅ¿ideration be?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Even the truth of the ChriÅ¿tian religion, which being compriÅ¿ed in thoÅ¿e books and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is evident that credence muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be given to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But how will you prove to me that the ChriÅ¿tian Religion is true?</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113294:7"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the very Author of the ChriÅ¿tian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who was a divine man; and by the very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it Å¿elf, which is alÅ¿o divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Whence doth it appear that the Author of the ChriÅ¿tian Religion was a man truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From the truly divine miracles which he wrought. As alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e having undergone a moÅ¿t bitter death in witneÅ¿Å¿e of the Religion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him, he was by God raiÅ¿ed from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How know you that he did miracles, and that thoÅ¿e miracles were divine?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is evident that he did miracles, not only from the teÅ¿timony of his DiÅ¿ciples, but alÅ¿o of his profeÅ¿Å¿ed enemies, Å¿uch as the Jewes are. And that thoÅ¿e miracles were divine you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ily acknowledge, when I Å¿hall have Å¿hown that he was raiÅ¿ed from the dead by God. For Å¿ince he affirmed, that he wrought his miracles by the power of God, his ReÅ¿urrection from the dead putteth the matter out of queÅ¿tion, and conÅ¿equently evinceth that his miracles were truly divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Shew therefore that he was raiÅ¿ed from the dead by God?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That he was raiÅ¿ed from the dead by God, is hence apparent; firÅ¿t becauÅ¿e there were many preÅ¿ently after his death, who conÅ¿tantly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had Å¿een him raiÅ¿ed from the dead, and for this very reaÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e they affirmed him to have been raiÅ¿ed from the dead, they Å¿uffered many calamities, and Å¿ome loÅ¿t their very lives. Again, an innumerable multitude of others recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Å¿ame from thoÅ¿e that went before,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113294:8"/> did upon the Å¿ame ground endure very great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and moÅ¿t exquiÅ¿ite deaths. From whence it followeth neceÅ¿Å¿arily, either that JeÅ¿us was raiÅ¿ed from the dead, or that they by conÅ¿tantly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing which they knew to be falÅ¿e, did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly involve themÅ¿elves in Å¿o many calamities, and Å¿o bitter deaths. The latter could by no means come to paÅ¿Å¿e, inaÅ¿much as very common Å¿enÅ¿e doth abundantly refute it; And therefore it is apparent that the firÅ¿t is altogether true.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What other argument hereof have you?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Namely, that it is altogether incredible, that Å¿uch a Religion as brings no worldly Å¿plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, commodity or pleaÅ¿ure to the ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors thereof, but rather robs them of the Å¿ame, caÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into various Å¿traits and afflictions, Å¿hould be imbraced by Å¿o many Nations, had it not beene confirmed by the ReÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You have Å¿hown that the Author of the ChriÅ¿tian Religion was a divine man; I would alÅ¿o have you Å¿hew, that the very Religion it Å¿elf is divine?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You may already have perceived, that from the divine Author thereof, nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e it may be alÅ¿o acknowledged from thoÅ¿e things whereof this Religion doth conÅ¿iÅ¿t, namely from the Precepts and PromiÅ¿es thereof; as alÅ¿o from all the circumÅ¿tances of the Å¿ame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How is it gathered from the Precepts and PromiÅ¿es that this Religion is divine?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e both the Precepts comprehend perfect holineÅ¿Å¿e of life, and the PromiÅ¿es perfect happineÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> This may be eaÅ¿ily perceived, if you conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who they were that firÅ¿t founded this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely mean and contemptible perÅ¿ons; and withall, that they did it without any worldly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wealth, wiÅ¿dome, or authority, making uÅ¿e of nothing but preaching and perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, to draw men to their opinion.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e in a very Å¿hort Å¿pace this Religion wonderfully encreaÅ¿ed, whileÅ¿t innumerable Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and perÅ¿ons, both learned and unlearned, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ignoble, of either Å¿ex, renouncing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions received by tradition from their Fathers, embraced this Religion, being neither allured with any commodities of this life, nor affrighted with any calamities that uÅ¿ually attend this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But what think you of the Å¿econd teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113294:11"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ApoÅ¿tle in that place doth not Å¿peak of mortality, but of death it Å¿elf: but there is a wide difference between death and mortality, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aÅ¿much as a man may be mortall, and yet never die.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label>. What therefore is the meaning of thoÅ¿e words, that death entred into the world by Å¿in?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Namely this, that <hi>Adam</hi> for Å¿in was by the decree and Å¿entence of God Å¿ubjected to eternall death, and conÅ¿equently all men, inaÅ¿much as they are propagated from him, are liable to the Å¿ame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death: that the thing is Å¿o, the compariÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t with <hi>Adam,</hi> which the ApoÅ¿tle maketh in the Å¿ame chapter from the twelfth verÅ¿e to the end, doth Å¿ufficiently intimate.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> I obÅ¿erve that man by nature hath nothing common with immortality; but how prove you that he could not by himÅ¿elfe know the way leading thereunto?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It may be proved thus, becauÅ¿e that knowledge doth far exceed mans reaÅ¿on, as the ApoÅ¿tle expreÅ¿Å¿ely Å¿aith, an animall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Å¿pirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. meaning the things whereof he had Å¿poken a little before <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>and</hi> 10. which neither eye hath Å¿een, nor ear heard, nor ever came up into the heart of man, which God hath prepared for thoÅ¿e which lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> him. But he hath revealed them to us by the Spirit. All which that it is to be underÅ¿tood of immortality, and the way and means tending thereunto, is evident from the very thing it Å¿elf.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But can you make this plain by another te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timony of the Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes; by that <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. 20. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113294:11"/> Å¿aith, That what may be known of God is manifeÅ¿t in them, for God hath manifeÅ¿ted it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For the inviÅ¿ible things of him from the foundation of the world, being underÅ¿tood by his works are Å¿een; both his eternall power and divinity; Å¿o that they are inexcuÅ¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But how appeareth it plainly from that testimony?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tle affirmeth thoÅ¿e things which God hath by the GoÅ¿pell diÅ¿covered to men, to be Å¿uch as were inviÅ¿ible from the very creation of the world. So that they could by no means be traced out by men. For the very matter, which the ApoÅ¿tle in this place propoÅ¿eth to be handled, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth that thoÅ¿e works, whereby the inviÅ¿ible things of God were known, are to be underÅ¿tood of the works done under the GoÅ¿pell.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But that place is commonly interpreted in another Å¿enÅ¿e?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> I am not ignorant thereof, but that cometh to paÅ¿Å¿e, becauÅ¿e they read the paÅ¿Å¿age otherwiÅ¿e then it was written by the ApoÅ¿tle. For whereas the ApoÅ¿tle wrote, From the creation of the world, they read, By the creation of the world. Again, they joyn the Å¿ame words not with the clauÅ¿e going before, (an example of which joyning you have in the 13. of <hi>Mat. ver.</hi> 35. I will open my mouth in parables, I will diÅ¿cloÅ¿e things hidden from the foundation of the world) but with the clauÅ¿e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, as if the ApoÅ¿tle meant that the inviÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of God were Å¿een by the Creation of the world.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I know it well, but they are grievouÅ¿ly miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, producing arguments for it out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ill underÅ¿tood.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What are their arguments wherewith they endeavour to prove their opinion?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The chief are theÅ¿e. FirÅ¿t they Å¿ay that the Scripture calleth not only the Father, but alÅ¿o the Son, and the Holy Spirit, God; And foraÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Å¿ame Scripture affirmeth that there is but one God, hence they gather, that theÅ¿e Three are that one God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How muÅ¿t this Argument be Å¿olved?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> I will firÅ¿t make anÅ¿wer concerning the Son, and then concerning the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anÅ¿wer will you make concerning the Son?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The word [GOD] is two wayes chiefly uÅ¿ed in the Scripture. The firÅ¿t is, when it deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, who both in the heavens, and on the earth, doth Å¿o rule and exerciÅ¿e dominion over all, that he acknowledgeth no Å¿uperior, and is Å¿o the Author and Principall of all things, as that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on none. The other is, when it deÅ¿igneth him who hath Å¿ome Å¿ublime dominion from that one God, and Å¿o is in Å¿ome Å¿ort partaker of his DeÃ¯ty. Hence is it that the Scripture calleth that one God the <hi>God of Gods,</hi> or moÅ¿t <hi>high God. PÅ¿al.</hi> 50. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. And in the latter Å¿ignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Son of God is in certain places of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture dignified with the title of a God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How prove you that the Son of God is in this latter Å¿ignification dignified with the title of a God?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From the very words of the Son himÅ¿elf,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113294:15"/> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 10. 35. <hi>If he call them Gods, to whom the Word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; Å¿ay ye of him whom the Father hath Å¿anctified and Å¿ent into the world, Thou blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest, becauÅ¿e I Å¿aid, I am the Son of God?</hi> By this Å¿peech ChriÅ¿t doth clearly intimate, both that the word [GOD] is Å¿omtime attributed unto them in the Scripture who are far inferiour to that one God; as alÅ¿o that he called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf the Son of God, and conÅ¿equently a God, for no greater reaÅ¿on then becauÅ¿e he had been Å¿anctified by the Father, and Å¿ent into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But what anÅ¿wer give you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Holy Spirit is no where in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expreÅ¿ly called God; and though in Å¿ome places the things of God are attributed to him, yet doth it not thereupon follow, that he is either God, or a perÅ¿on of the Deity, Å¿ince this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth for another cauÅ¿e, as you Å¿hall hear in in its place.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat is the Å¿econd argument wherewith they go about to prove the three PerÅ¿ons in one Deity?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is taken from thoÅ¿e places, wherein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhich are thoÅ¿e places?</p>

                  <label>A.</label> 
                  <hi>The firÅ¿t is that, where JeÅ¿us command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ApoÅ¿ties to make all Nations DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> baptizing them into the name of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113294:15"/> Father; and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Mat. 28. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Å¿econd is, that where the ApoÅ¿tle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in this manner.</hi> There are diverÅ¿ities of Gifts, but the Å¿ame Spirit. And diverÅ¿ities of MiniÅ¿teries, but the Å¿ame Lord. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ities of Operations, but the Å¿ame God, that operateth all the things in all, 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6. <hi>And afterwards in the eleventh verÅ¿e of the Å¿ame chapter, he Å¿aith,</hi> But all theÅ¿e things operateth one and the Å¿ame Spirit, diÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to every one as he will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third is in</hi> John, 1 EpiÅ¿t. 5. 7. There are three that hear witneÅ¿Å¿e in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and theÅ¿e three are one.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What are we to think of theÅ¿e Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In generall I anÅ¿wer, that theÅ¿e Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations onely Å¿hew that there is a Father, Sonne, and Holy Spirit, which we not only acknowledge, but conÅ¿tantly aÅ¿Å¿ert, Å¿o that we pronounce him to be no ChriÅ¿tian, who is either ignorant thereof, or doth not believe it. But it is evident that theÅ¿e Quotations do not demonÅ¿trate the Father, Sonne, and Holy Spirit to be three PerÅ¿ons in one Divine EÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Yet from Å¿uch a Conjunction of thoÅ¿e three in divine Operations, it Å¿eemeth Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what probable that they are three PerÅ¿ons in one divine EÅ¿Å¿ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means. For as to the firÅ¿t place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113294:16"/> the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in BaptiÅ¿m, yet doth it not therefore follow that they are PerÅ¿ons in one divine EÅ¿Å¿ence, both for that it is Å¿aid in the words immediately going before, that all power in heaven &amp; on earth was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Son, which cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly agree to him that is a PerÅ¿on in the divine EÅ¿Å¿ence; as alÅ¿o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it is no new thing for the Scripture, in other things no leÅ¿Å¿e divine then BaptiÅ¿m, to joyn with God Å¿uch PerÅ¿ons and Things, as no wayes pertain to the divine EÅ¿Å¿ence. Of PerÅ¿ons you have an example in the firÅ¿t book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> chap. 12. 18. <hi>And all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.</hi> And in <hi>MoÅ¿es, Exod.</hi> 14. 31. where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew it is read, <hi>And the people feared the Lord, and believed in the Lord, and in his Å¿ervant MoÅ¿es.</hi> Of things you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace.</hi> &amp; EpheÅ¿. 6. 10. <hi>Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then your Å¿elves in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But they hold he muÅ¿t needs be God, into whoÅ¿e name we are baptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are exceedingly miÅ¿taken, for we read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. that the IÅ¿raelites were all baptized into <hi>MoÅ¿es.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 3. that certain DiÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were baptized into the BaptiÅ¿me of <hi>John;</hi> Although neither <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> were God, nor the BaptiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of <hi>John</hi> a PerÅ¿on, much leÅ¿Å¿e God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But it Å¿eemeth one thing to be baptized into any ones name, and another to be baptized into any one?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means. For by vertue of the Hebrew IdiotiÅ¿me, it is oftentimes all one to do Å¿omething
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113294:16"/> into any ones name, and into any one, as is Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known. Neither need we go far for any inÅ¿tance, Å¿ince the matter in hand will readily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h us, for whereas we read in Å¿ome places, that <hi>DiÅ¿ciples were baptized into the name of ChriÅ¿t,</hi> Å¿ee <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 5. we read in others, that they were Å¿imply baptized into ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anÅ¿wer give you to the Å¿econd Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That although divine operations be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and to the Lord, and to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet can it not be rightly inferred thence, that theÅ¿e three are of one eÅ¿Å¿ence. Yea the contrary may be thence clearly collected, namely that they cannot be of one eÅ¿Å¿ence, Å¿ince the Lord and the Holy Spirit are openly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed from God, whom we formerly proved to be no other then the Father of our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. But becauÅ¿e to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with God, mention is here made of the Lord, and of the Holy Spirit, this is therefore done, becauÅ¿e the Lord is he by whom God doth work all theÅ¿e things, with the concurrent miniÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Holy Spirit, for here he treateth only of thoÅ¿e things that appertain unto the faithfull, in whom the Holy Spirit worketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anÅ¿wer give you to the third?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> FirÅ¿t Å¿ince it is known that in the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greek copies, and in the Syriack, and in the more antient Latin VerÅ¿ions, theÅ¿e words are not extant, as the chiefeÅ¿t of our AdverÅ¿aries do Å¿hew, nothing certain can be concluded from them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though they were extant in the Scripture, yet could it not be thence concluded, that there are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113294:17"/> three PerÅ¿ons in one Divinity. For that place Å¿peaketh of no other thing then of witneÅ¿Å¿ing that JeÅ¿us is the Son of God, or the ChriÅ¿t. But that this may be atteÅ¿ted, not only by Å¿uch as are divine perÅ¿ons, but even by Å¿uch as are no perÅ¿ons at all, appeareth by the following words, wherein the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tle Å¿aith, that there are three that bear witneÅ¿Å¿e on the earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Bloud. Now when he Å¿aith that the former three are one, that this is meant of their being one in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timony and agreement, but not in eÅ¿Å¿ence, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the following verÅ¿e, where the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion is found, and muÅ¿t be taken in Å¿uch a Å¿enÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> I perceive by your former diÅ¿courÅ¿e, that there is but one PerÅ¿on in the divine eÅ¿Å¿ence, and therefore I would now know how the knowledge hereof is very conducible to Å¿alvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You will eaÅ¿ily perceive that, if you conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how pernitious the opinion of the AdverÅ¿e Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is. For firÅ¿t, that opinion may eaÅ¿ily undermine and weaken the belief of one God, whileÅ¿t one while it confeÅ¿Å¿eth but one God, another while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth three PerÅ¿ons, every one whereof is that one God. Secondly it obÅ¿cureth the glory of that one God, who is only the Father of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, whileÅ¿t it transferreth it to another, who is not the Father. Thirdly, it may eaÅ¿ily pervert the way of Å¿alvation, whileÅ¿t it taketh away the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd cauÅ¿e thereof, and Å¿uff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reth us not rightly to acknowledge who is the prime Author of our Salvation and how God manageth the Å¿ame by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and the Holy Spirit. In Å¿ine, it greatly hindreth Aliens from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113294:17"/> embracing the ChriÅ¿tian Religion, whileÅ¿t it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth Å¿uch things as are oppoÅ¿ite to divine Truth and Å¿ound reaÅ¿on. From all which inconveniences that opinion is free which holdeth that there is but one PerÅ¿on in the divine eÅ¿Å¿ence.</p>

                  <hi>true God]</hi> referred unto ChriÅ¿t) that ChriÅ¿t was mentioned immediately before. For relatives are not alwaies referred to the antecedents immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately going before, but oftentimes to that which is chiefly Å¿poken of, as appeareth from theÅ¿e places, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 18, 19. <hi>Till another King aroÅ¿e, which knew not</hi> JoÅ¿eph. <hi>The Å¿ame,</hi> (or, he) <hi>dealt Å¿ubtilly with with our kindred.</hi> Act. 10. 6. <hi>He</hi> (Peter) <hi>lodgeth with one Simon a Tanner, whoÅ¿e houÅ¿e is by the Å¿ea-Å¿ide: he Å¿hall tell thee what thou oughteÅ¿t to do.</hi> 2 EpiÅ¿t of <hi>John v.</hi> 7. <hi>Many deceivers are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, who confeÅ¿Å¿e not IeÅ¿us, coming in fleÅ¿h, to be Christ. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</hi> From which places it appeareth that the relative hath not reÅ¿pect to the neereÅ¿t antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but to that which is more remote. Wherefore the meaning of thoÅ¿e words of <hi>Iohn [This is the true God, and eternall life]</hi> is thus; This where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have laÅ¿t Å¿poken is the true God, (namely he that hath for his Son, JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t;) and it is alÅ¿o eternall life, (namely to know the true God, and to be in him by his Son, JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.) With this accordeth that paÅ¿Å¿age of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 3. <hi>This is Life eternall, that they know thee</hi> (Father) <hi>the only true God, and whom thou haÅ¿t Å¿ent, IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi>

But this obÅ¿ervation taken from the unity of the article prefixed to Å¿everall

The firÅ¿t of which reaÅ¿ons was Å¿olved a little before. To the Å¿econd I anÅ¿wer, that <hi>Paul</hi> in the Greek doth not Å¿ay, <hi>(the glorious appearing of the great God)</hi> but <hi>(the appearing of the glory of the great God.)</hi> Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall come to judge the world, not only in his own glory, but alÅ¿o in the glory of his Father. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 27. Again, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience is it to Å¿ay, that when ChriÅ¿t cometh to judge the world, God doth come? Å¿ince ChriÅ¿t in judging the world, Å¿uÅ¿taineth the perÅ¿on of God, from whom he hath received his authority of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting judgement.</p>

                  <label>A.</label> The Å¿ixth teÅ¿timony is this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.</hi> This paÅ¿Å¿age is therefore by the adverÅ¿aries referred to ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e they Å¿uppoÅ¿e that none is to come but ChriÅ¿t, for he is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113294:25"/> to come to judge the quick and dead.

Neither is there any one that may not eaÅ¿ily obÅ¿erve that the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God is here deÅ¿cribed, which comprehendeth the time paÅ¿t, preÅ¿ent, and future. But that which detecteth this groÅ¿Å¿e miÅ¿take, is <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4, 5. where we read, <hi>Grace and peace be to you, from him that was, and is, and is to come, and from the Å¿even Spirits that are before his Throne, and from JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the faithfull and true witneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> From which teÅ¿timony it appeareth that <hi>JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t</hi> is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother then He that is<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and was, and is to come.</p>

BeÅ¿ides, that thoÅ¿e words, <hi>(all things in the heaven, and on the earth)</hi> are not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed for all things Å¿imply and abÅ¿olutely, appeareth both by the article in the Greek Å¿et before the word <hi>(all)</hi> to limit it, and alÅ¿o by the collation of the words put a little after in the 20. verÅ¿e, where the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, <hi>That by him God hath reconciled all the things that are both in the heavens, and on the earth;</hi> and finally by the inÅ¿pection of the very words themÅ¿elves, wherein the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith not, that the heaven and earth were created by ChriÅ¿t, but all the things that are in the heavens, and on the earth.</p>

                  <label>A.</label> That it is not here Å¿aid, that the Son made the world, but God made it by the Son. Now that the word <hi>(world)</hi> may not only Å¿ignifie that which is paÅ¿t and preÅ¿ent, but alÅ¿o that which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113294:29"/> is to come, is confeÅ¿Å¿ed. And that it is here Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the world to come, is evident from hence, namely that the Å¿ame Author affirmeth, that by him, whom God hath appointed heire of all things, the world was made. For JeÅ¿us of Nazareth was not appointed heire of all things, before God had raiÅ¿ed him up from the dead, which is apparent, becauÅ¿e then at length all power in heaven and earth was given to him by God the Father, in the donation of which power, and not in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that inheritance of all things is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anÅ¿wer you to the fifth?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> This teÅ¿timony doth not expreÅ¿ly Å¿peak of ChriÅ¿t, but of God. But foraÅ¿much as this divine Author doth apply it unto the Son of God, it is to be conÅ¿idered, that the words expreÅ¿ly Å¿peak, not of one thing, but of twain chiefly: The one whereof is the creation of heaven and earth; the other is the abolition of the things created. Now that this Author doth not referre the firÅ¿t unto ChriÅ¿t, is from hence apparent, namely becauÅ¿e he propoÅ¿ed to himÅ¿elf to demonÅ¿trate, not that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ChriÅ¿t, which he hath from himÅ¿elf, but that which he obtained by inheritance, and whereby he was made better then Angells, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from the fourth verÅ¿e of this firÅ¿t chapter of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> of which kind of excellency Å¿ince the creation of heaven and earth neither is, nor can be, it is evident that this teÅ¿timony was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to prove that ChriÅ¿t created the heaven and earth. Since therefore the firÅ¿t cannot be referred to ChriÅ¿t, it is apparent that the latter only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to him; and that therefore, becauÅ¿e God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113294:29"/> will aboliÅ¿h both the heaven and earth by ChriÅ¿t, <hi>when he judgeth the world by him.</hi> Wherein the excellency of ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall Å¿o far Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿e that of Angels, that the very Angels Å¿hall therein miniÅ¿ter to him. Which latter Å¿peech, Å¿ince it could not be underÅ¿tood without the words going before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mention is made of the heaven and earth, inaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is joyned to them by the word <hi>(they)</hi> the author was therefore neceÅ¿Å¿itated to repeat them alÅ¿o. For if other Å¿acred Writers do in that manner cite teÅ¿timonies of the Scripture, when they are preÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed with no neceÅ¿Å¿ity, much more ought this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Å¿o to do, when he was neceÅ¿Å¿itated thereunto.</p>

Finally in this very ch. to the <hi>Heb.</hi> v 9. where it is apparent that theÅ¿e words, <hi>(Thou lovedÅ¿t righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and hatedÅ¿t iniquity)</hi> are not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to what the divine Author goeth about to prove, namely that ChriÅ¿t is made better then Angels.</p>

BeÅ¿ides, the Greek word which is by the EngliÅ¿h TranÅ¿lators rendered <hi>(upholding)</hi> ought to have been rendered <hi>(carrying)</hi> which hath rather the Å¿ignification of ordering and mannaging, then of conÅ¿erving, as that which is annexed, [namely, <hi>by the word of his power]</hi> Å¿eemeth to intimate.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As to the firÅ¿t, the ApoÅ¿tle doth not at all Å¿ay,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113294:30"/> that ChriÅ¿t was in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e with the people of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> and did good to them. For though he write that the Rock, whereof the people drank, was ChriÅ¿t, yet doth not he therefore aÅ¿Å¿ert that ChriÅ¿t was indeed there, becauÅ¿e thoÅ¿e words of <hi>Paul</hi> may be figuratively taken. Now whereas he calleth that Rock Å¿pirituall, this doth nothing advantage the cauÅ¿e of the adverÅ¿aries, Å¿ince that Rock may be called Å¿pirituall, although it were Indeed materiall, for the Å¿ame cauÅ¿e that the meat was called Å¿piritual, namely in that it contained in it a myÅ¿tical Å¿enÅ¿e, as in the Revelation <hi>John</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>That the great City, where our Lord was Å¿lain, is Å¿piritually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sodom and Egypt, Rev.</hi> 11. 8. Moreover in that he faith, <hi>that the Rock followed them,</hi> it is to be underÅ¿tood of the water iÅ¿Å¿uing out of the Rock, and following the people through the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, which before was deÅ¿titute of running water, or at leaÅ¿t of Å¿uch as was potable. To which <hi>IÅ¿aiah, ch.</hi> 43. 20. doth allude, where he Å¿aith, <hi>The beast of the field Å¿hall honour me, the Dragons, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿triches; for I have given them waters in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneÅ¿Å¿e, and rivers in the deÅ¿ert; to give drink to my people, my ChoÅ¿en.</hi> As for the Å¿econd teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, namely, <hi>Let us not tempt ChriÅ¿t, as Å¿ome of them tempted:</hi> From theÅ¿e words likewiÅ¿e it can not be Å¿hown that ChriÅ¿t was indeed tempted in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e. For inÅ¿tance, Å¿hould any man Å¿ay, let us not be refractory to the MagiÅ¿trate, as Å¿ome of our AnceÅ¿tors were: it could not thence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Å¿ame numericall MagiÅ¿trate is in both places deÅ¿igned. Now if there be found in the Scriptures Å¿uch kinds of Å¿peaking, wherein the like Å¿peech is referred to him, (whoÅ¿e name was a little before expreÅ¿Å¿ed) without any repetition of the Å¿ame perÅ¿on, this hap'neth in Å¿uch a place, where no other,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113294:31"/> beÅ¿ides him whoÅ¿e name was expreÅ¿Å¿ed, can poÅ¿Å¿ibly be underÅ¿tood, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Thou Å¿halt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedÅ¿t in MaÅ¿Å¿ah.</hi> But in this Å¿peech of the ApoÅ¿tle, whereof we Å¿peak, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other then ChriÅ¿t may be underÅ¿tood, as <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> the Angel, &amp;c.

                  <label>A.</label> FirÅ¿t that in many ancient copies, and in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar TranÅ¿lation, the word <hi>(God)</hi> is not here found; Å¿o that nothing certain can be concluded out of this place. Again, though we read the word <hi>[God]</hi> there, yet is there no cauÅ¿e, why it Å¿hould not be referred to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Å¿ince it may of him be affirmed, that he was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿ted in ChriÅ¿t and the ApoÅ¿tles, who were fleÅ¿h. And though it be afterwards, according to the vulgar tranÅ¿lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, read, that <hi>he was received up into glory,</hi> yet is it in the Greek, <hi>he was received in glory,</hi> that is, with glory, or gloriouÅ¿ly.</p>

The ChriÅ¿tian Religion is full of myÅ¿teries. For God, that is, the divine Will touching the Å¿alvation of men, was perfectly diÅ¿covered by weak and mortall men, and yet notwithÅ¿tanding by reaÅ¿on of the miracles wrought by the Å¿pirit in confirmation of the GoÅ¿pel, it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113294:33"/> for true. The Å¿ame was at length perceived by the Angels themÅ¿elves, &amp; preached not only to the Jews, but alÅ¿o to the Gentiles, and not only generally believed, but entertained with the greateÅ¿t glory and magnificence.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That it cannot from thence be demonÅ¿trated that ChriÅ¿t had (as the adverÅ¿aries Å¿peak) a Divine Nature, may (to omit what hath been formerly Å¿poken) be made appear from hence, namely that it is Å¿poken in the firÅ¿t teÅ¿timony touching Å¿uch a word as was with God. In the Å¿econd, <hi>Thomas</hi> calleth him his God, in whoÅ¿e hands and feet he found the prints of the nails, and in his Å¿ide the print of the Å¿pear. And <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith, that he, <hi>who was of the Fathers according to the fleÅ¿h, was over all a God to be bleÅ¿Å¿ed for evermore.</hi> All which it is cleer cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly be Å¿aid of him that is God by Nature. For from the firÅ¿t it would follow, that there are two Gods, whereof the one was with the other. As for the other twain, namely to have the prints of wounds, and to be of the Fathers, do altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a man, which that they Å¿hould be aÅ¿cribed to him that is God by Nature, is very abÅ¿urd. But if any one to cloak the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e pretend the diÅ¿tinction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we have formerly removed that, and taught that this diÅ¿tinction is not to be endured.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> Where doth the Scripture teach that Christ is one with the Father?</p>
               <p>

               <p>I and my Father are one.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What Å¿ay you to this proof?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> When it is Å¿aid that ChriÅ¿t is one with the Father, it cannot be thence evinced that he is one with him in Nature, as the words of ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf Å¿poken to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the DiÅ¿ciples to demonÅ¿trate: Å¿ee <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep them in thy name whom thou haÅ¿t given to me, that they may be one, as we are one.</hi> And afterwards v. 22

                  <hi>The glory which thou haÅ¿t given me have I given them, that they may be one as we are one.</hi> Now that ChriÅ¿t is one with the Father, this ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of unity or oneneÅ¿Å¿e in will or power, as to the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of mans Salvation. Yea that the Divine Nature of ChriÅ¿t cannot be proved out of that place, is evident from the place it Å¿elf, where ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith, <hi>The Father is greater then all,</hi> and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently then the Son, as the Son himÅ¿elf elÅ¿where confeÅ¿Å¿eth, <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. and that he gave thoÅ¿e Å¿heep to ChriÅ¿t.</p>

Therefore the Iewes Å¿ought the more to Å¿lay him, in that he had not only broken the Sabbath, but alÅ¿o called God his own Father, making himÅ¿elf equall to God. <hi>And</hi> Phil. 2. 6.

                  <label>A.</label> That ChriÅ¿t is equall to God no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a Divine Nature in him, yea the contrary is hence collected. For if ChriÅ¿t be equall to God, who is God by Nature, he cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly be the Å¿ame God. But the equality of ChriÅ¿t with God herein conÅ¿iÅ¿teth, that by the power which God conferred on him, he did all thoÅ¿e things (and will do them) which pertain to God himÅ¿elf, as if he were very God.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> What do you anÅ¿wer to theÅ¿e places?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From all thoÅ¿e attributes cannot be proved any Divine Nature of ChriÅ¿t. For as to the firÅ¿t, it is apparent that <hi>Peter</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth the Son of Man to be the ChriÅ¿t, the Son of the living God, who it is certain had not a Divine Nature, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Again, the Scripture teÅ¿tifieth of other men, that they are Sons of the living God, as <hi>Paul</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it out of <hi>HoÅ¿ea, Rom</hi> 9. 26. and it Å¿hall be in the place, where it was Å¿aid unto them, <hi>you are not my people,</hi> they Å¿hall be there called the Sons of the living God. But as to the Å¿econd and third places, in them we read that the proper and only begotten Son of God was not Å¿pared, but given and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to death for us, which cannot be Å¿aid of him that is God by Nature. Yea, from thence that ChriÅ¿t is the Son of God, it is apparent that he is not God, otherwiÅ¿e he will be the Son of himÅ¿elf. Now the reaÅ¿on why thoÅ¿e attributes are aÅ¿cribed to ChriÅ¿t, is this, becauÅ¿e amongÅ¿t all the Sons of God, he is both the chiefeÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t deare to God, as <hi>IÅ¿aac,</hi> becauÅ¿e he was moÅ¿t dear to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the heir of all things, is called the only begotten, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. although he had a brother <hi>IÅ¿mael.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> is called <hi>the only-begotten in the fight of his Mother, Prov.</hi> 4. 3. although he had more brethren of the Å¿ame mother, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 3. 5.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Neither can it be hence concluded, that ChriÅ¿t hath a Divine Nature. For Å¿ince ChriÅ¿t is the firÅ¿t-born of every creature, it muÅ¿t needs be that he alÅ¿o is one of the creatures. For Å¿uch is the force of the word <hi>(firÅ¿t-born)</hi> in the Scripture, that it muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be one of them amongÅ¿t whom it is the firÅ¿t born; as the firÅ¿t-born of Å¿heep is a Å¿heep, of aÅ¿Å¿es an aÅ¿Å¿e, of men a man. But that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be the firÅ¿t-born of creatures in the Old crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the adverÅ¿aries themÅ¿elves muÅ¿t not admit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e they will become Arrians. Wherfore they muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e that the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is one of the New Creation. Whence the Divine Nature of ChriÅ¿t is not only not concluded, but it is on the contrary firmly concluded, that he hath no Divine Nature. But that ChriÅ¿t is by the ApoÅ¿tle called by that name, doth hence proceed, namely that he both in time and dignity precedeth all other things of the New Creation.</p>

BeÅ¿ides, inaÅ¿much as whatÅ¿oever ChriÅ¿t hath, he hath it from the grant of the Father, and not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:113294:36"/> from himÅ¿elf, it is hence evident, that he hath no Å¿uch Divine Nature as is imagined. Since he that is a God by Nature hath all things from himÅ¿elf.</p>

For this quite Å¿ubverteth the common Doctrine of the Trinity, by confounding the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd PerÅ¿ons thereof. But the words may wel be rendred a Father of eternity, or an everlaÅ¿ting Father, both becauÅ¿e he is the Author of eternall life to them that obey him, and liveth for ever to Å¿helter and protect and cheriÅ¿h ChriÅ¿tians, who are elÅ¿where called his Å¿eed.

For proof of this, Å¿ee <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 45. Neither laÅ¿tly can the divine Nature of ChriÅ¿t be evinced from thence, namely that all the fulneÅ¿Å¿e of the Godhead, or of Deity, dwelleth in him bodily; Å¿ince this word <hi>(God-head)</hi> may denote the divine wil; Å¿ee <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 19. &amp; foraÅ¿much as the ApoÅ¿tle doth oppoÅ¿e that Å¿peech, not to perÅ¿ons, but to PhiloÅ¿ophy &amp; legall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, it is evident that it is meant of the Doctrine of ChriÅ¿t, not of his PerÅ¿on.

Moreover, whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As to the firÅ¿t, the divine nature of ChriÅ¿t cannot be concluded from the ApoÅ¿tles calling him that one Lord. For firÅ¿t, he manifeÅ¿tly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him from the father, whom he confeÅ¿Å¿eth to be that one God, whom we formerly Å¿hewed to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113294:38"/> the onely God by nature. Again, the ApoÅ¿tle by Å¿aying that all things are by him, Å¿heweth that he is not God by nature. Since, as we formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿trated this particle [by] doth not deÅ¿igne the firÅ¿t, but the Å¿econd cauÅ¿e, which cannot be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him that is God by nature. And though the Å¿cripture Å¿omtimes Å¿aith of the Father, <hi>that all things are by him,</hi> yet is this otherwiÅ¿e underÅ¿tood of him, then of ChriÅ¿t: For this is Å¿poken of the father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e all the middle cauÅ¿es, whereby Å¿omething is done, are derived from him, and are not Å¿uch, as that God cannot work without them, but it is Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t, that Å¿ome other, namely God, who muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity therefore be the firÅ¿t cauÅ¿e, doth work all things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9. It is expreÅ¿ly Å¿aid. I need not commemorate that the word [all] is here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trained unto the Å¿ubject matter, as the very arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Å¿et before it in the Greek Å¿ufficienly Å¿heweth, Much more theÅ¿e two words [us] and [Father] which plainly demonÅ¿trate that <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaketh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the things that pertain to ChriÅ¿tians, whence it followeth that ChriÅ¿t is not called that one Lord Å¿imply, and abÅ¿olutely, but for a certain reÅ¿pect, as being he, by whom all the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to ChriÅ¿tians are adminiÅ¿tred. As for the Å¿econd teÅ¿timony, Å¿ince it is there treated of him that was crucified, it is clear that the divine nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thence be concluded, Å¿ince no Å¿uch thing can be affirmed of the divine nature, but only of a man, who is therefore called the Lord of glory, that is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hebrew PhraÅ¿e the glorious Lord, becauÅ¿e he was by God crowned with glory and honour. In the third teÅ¿timony Å¿ince it is Å¿poken of him who is a lamb, &amp; clothed with garments, whom the Å¿ame <hi>John</hi> moÅ¿t openly teÅ¿tifieth to have been Å¿lain, and to have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113294:39"/> redeemed us with his blood, (which thing can by no means be referred to the divine nature) it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the divine nature of ChriÅ¿t cannot thence be aÅ¿Å¿erted, but all the things that are in theÅ¿e teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies aÅ¿cribed to ChriÅ¿t argue his Å¿ingular autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to him by God, in relation to the things of the new covenant.</p>

                  <label>AnÅ¿wer,</label> As to the firÅ¿t, it is Å¿o far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that ChriÅ¿t is God by nature, that it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿heweth him to be a far different one.

                  <hi>WHat are ChriÅ¿ts Ceremoniall Precepts, as they call them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> There is but one, namely the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is an InÅ¿titution of the Lord, that the Faithfull Å¿hould break, and eat the Bread, and drink of the Cup, to declare the death of the Lord; which InÅ¿titution is to continue till the Lords coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is it to declare the Lords death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is in a Å¿olemn and publick manner to give thanks, that he, out of his unÅ¿peakable love, would Å¿uffer his body to be tortured, and in a manner bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his Bloud to be Å¿hed for us, and Å¿o to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll and celebrate this great benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhy would the Lord have the memory of this thing above all others, to be celebrated in his Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e of all the actions of ChriÅ¿t it is the chiefeÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t proper to him; for though the ReÅ¿urrection and Exaltation of ChriÅ¿t be far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet they were performed by God the Father, and not by ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Is there not another reaÅ¿on, for which the Lord inÅ¿tituted the Supper?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> None at all, although men have deviÅ¿ed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Å¿ome Å¿aying that it is a Å¿acrifice for the quick and dead; others, that by the uÅ¿e thereof, they gain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:113294:57"/> of their Sins, and hope to confirm their Faith, and bring to their remembrance the Lords death.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat are we to hold concerning theÅ¿e opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That none of them can Å¿tand; for Å¿ince that is the end of celebrating the Lords Supper, that we Å¿hould give thanks to ChriÅ¿t for benefits received, it is apparent that it was not therefore inÅ¿tituted, that we Å¿hould there receive Å¿omething, yea he that will worthily partake of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he ought to be aÅ¿Å¿ured of the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins on the part of God, and confirmed in the faith, and Å¿o affected, that the death of ChriÅ¿t never Å¿lip out of his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat are we to think of that opinion which Å¿aith, that the Supper is a Å¿acrifice for the quick and dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That it is a moÅ¿t grievous error; for the Scripture teÅ¿tifieth that the offering of ChriÅ¿t was performed in heaven, and could not be performed on the earth. BeÅ¿ides, Å¿ince ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf is both PrieÅ¿t and Å¿acrifice, it followeth that none can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ChriÅ¿t, but ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf. Finally, Å¿ince the Sacrifice of of ChriÅ¿t is altogether perfect, Å¿ince it is one, whereby he hath for ever perfected them that are Å¿anctified, there is no need that it Å¿hould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, otherwiÅ¿e it would not be perfect and abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1. 2, 3. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is the meaning of thoÅ¿e words, this is my body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are not taken by all in one and the Å¿ame manner, for Å¿ome think that the bread is truly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the body of ChriÅ¿t, and the wine into
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113294:58"/> his blood, which turning, they call TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, others think that the Lords body is with, in, and under the bread. Finally there are Å¿ome, who in the Lords Supper think they are truly parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Body and Blood of the Lord, but Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. All which Opinions are fallacious and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How will you demonÅ¿trate that?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e in theÅ¿e words [This is my Body] the particle [This] may be referred to the whole action of breaking, and taking the Bread, and pouring out the Wine. Wherefore it is not neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily referred to the Bread and Wine only by the AdverÅ¿aries; neither can their captious opinions be hence framed, and contrived. BeÅ¿ides, as to the TranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation it Å¿elf, (as they call it) Å¿ince the Scripture doth in the very uÅ¿e give the name of Bread, to that Berad we take, as appeareth from the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. and chap. 11. 26, 27, 28. It is evident, that Bread remaineth there without any tranÅ¿mutation into the Lords Body. Furthermore, the Å¿ame Scripture teÅ¿tifieth, that the Body of ChriÅ¿t is in the Heavens, and muÅ¿t be there contained till the times of the reÅ¿titution of all things: wherefore it cannot any more exiÅ¿t on the Earth. In a word, if the Bread were turned into the very Body of ChriÅ¿t, it would follow, that the immortall Body of ChriÅ¿t (wherewith all agree, that he is now endued) is taken in a groÅ¿Å¿e and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall manner: but this cannot be, that an immortall Body Å¿hould be Å¿o taken, and conÅ¿equently neither can the Bread be turned into ChriÅ¿ts Body. As to the Å¿econd Opinion, that, as it cannot conÅ¿iÅ¿t for the former reaÅ¿ons, eÅ¿pecially this, that the Body of ChriÅ¿t is now in the Heavens; Å¿o neither can it for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113294:58"/> his grand inconvenience, namely, that this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth deveÅ¿t the Body of ChriÅ¿t of its properties. LaÅ¿tly, as to the third Opinion, that cannot have place, Å¿ince it is abÅ¿utd, that one Å¿hould be really partaker of ChriÅ¿ts body, and alÅ¿o Å¿piritually. And they themÅ¿elves Å¿ufficiently bewray the uncertainty of their own opinion, whilÅ¿t they confeÅ¿Å¿e that this manner of receiving the Body of ChriÅ¿t is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inexplicable, or at leaÅ¿t that they are utterly ignorant how it is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is to be held touching the uÅ¿e of the Body, and Bloud of ChriÅ¿t?</hi> John 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> ChriÅ¿t doth not in that place treat of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for there he doth without any condition aÅ¿cribe Eternall Life to him that Å¿hall eat his FleÅ¿h, and drink his Blood; and on the contrary taketh Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life away from him that Å¿hall not eat his FleÅ¿h, and drink his Blood. Which, that it is not Å¿poken of the Lords Supper, is evident from hence, in that a man may partake of the Lords Supper, and yet periÅ¿h. And on the contrary may be Å¿aved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he partake not thereof. But ChriÅ¿t there Å¿peaketh concerning the cauÅ¿e of Faith on him, which is the continuall meditation of the death of ChriÅ¿t, from whence we derive Å¿trength unto a pious, and immortall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>How are thoÅ¿e words of</hi> Paul <hi>to be taken; The Cup of bleÅ¿Å¿ing which we bleÅ¿Å¿e, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Bloud of ChriÅ¿t? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of ChriÅ¿t?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In Å¿uch a manner, as that all thoÅ¿e who bleÅ¿Å¿e this Cup, that is, uÅ¿ing it, celebrate the name of the Lord, and bleÅ¿Å¿e him; and alÅ¿o thoÅ¿e that break the Bread in Communion, do thereby openly teÅ¿tifie,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113294:59"/> that they are partakers of the Body and Bloud of ChriÅ¿t, that is, of all thoÅ¿e things which ChriÅ¿t by his death hath procured to us. As he a little after Å¿peaketh of the IÅ¿raelites, Å¿aying, that the IÅ¿raelites, who did eat the Sacrifice, were partakers of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, that is, belonged unto all thoÅ¿e things, which were promiÅ¿ed in that Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Explicate therefore to me the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Å¿enÅ¿e of thoÅ¿e words, This is my Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is, as if ChriÅ¿t had Å¿aid, this action of breaking and eating this bread, is a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and certain adumbration of that which is to be done with my Body; and this action pouring out, and drinking this Wine, is a commemoration, and repreÅ¿entation of what is to be done with my Bloud; or (that we may explain the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25.) the drinking of this Cup is a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that exceÅ¿Å¿ive love of God exhibited to us in the New Covenant, and confirmed by the death of ChriÅ¿t. In this manner it is written concerning the Å¿olemn cuÅ¿tome of eating the PaÅ¿chal Lamb, (for they had their loynes girded, their feet Å¿hod, their Å¿taves in their hands, and did eat it haÅ¿tily) that it was the PaÅ¿Å¿eover of the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11, 27. Thus alÅ¿o, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. it is Å¿aid of the Å¿horn hairs, part whereof was burned, part Å¿cattered, part conÅ¿erved: that this was <hi>JeruÅ¿alem.</hi>

                  <label>A.</label> True, but he doth not therefore affirm, that that Laver of Regeneration is the BabtiÅ¿m of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neither is it unuÅ¿uall in the Scriptures, that the purlfication of our Souls, which is wrought by the Word, Å¿hould be Å¿iguratively called a Laver; for the Å¿ame, <hi>Paul, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 5. 26. writeth, That ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿anctified his Church, having purified her with the Laver of water in the Word. And the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> exhorteth them, who had long Å¿ince given their names to ChriÅ¿t, and did no more Å¿tand in need of the BaptiÅ¿me of water, that they Å¿hould have their hearts Å¿prinkled from an evill conÅ¿cience, and their body waÅ¿hed with pure water. Finally, the ApoÅ¿tle himÅ¿elf in this very place, which we have in hand, explaineth himÅ¿elf, what he meaneth by the Laver of Regeneration, Å¿ub-joyning thoÅ¿e words that give light to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ones, namely, [And renewing of the holy Spirit.] For that this particle [and] is Å¿ometimes

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is to be held, and we Å¿hall find this obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation give light to many other places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when in the writings of the new covenant, that is aÅ¿cribed to Å¿ome act or outward ceremony, which altogether belongeth to eternall Å¿alvation, this is not therefore done, as if that act or outward ceremony had Å¿uch power, but becauÅ¿e thereby a certain adumbration is made of that thing, which altogether belongeth to Å¿alvation. Thus when it is Å¿aid, The Cup of bleÅ¿Å¿ing which we bleÅ¿Å¿e, is it not the communion of the Blood of ChriÅ¿t? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of ChriÅ¿t? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and elÅ¿ewhere, as many of you, as have been baptiÅ¿ed into ChriÅ¿t, have put on ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. And after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the words of <hi>Ananias</hi> may and ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tood; although the place may be Å¿o conÅ¿train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that the meaning of <hi>Ananias</hi> was not that <hi>Paul</hi> by the BaptiÅ¿me of water Å¿hould waÅ¿h away his Å¿ins, but that he Å¿hould be baptiÅ¿ed, and waÅ¿h away his Å¿ins, by invocating the name of the Lord, Å¿ince the time was now come, wherein every one that called upon the name of the Lord Å¿hould be Å¿aved.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means, for there he Å¿peaketh of being born from above, but the water of BaptiÅ¿me co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

Now that water and the Å¿pirit are the Å¿ame in that place, Å¿o that by water is meant the Å¿pirit, or Å¿pirituall water, Å¿eem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thence to be plain, in that the particle [and] may in this place Å¿ignifie [that is] as we formerly Å¿hewed, that it Å¿ometimes Å¿ignifieth Å¿o in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by name in that paÅ¿Å¿age, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 11. which is like to this under conteÅ¿tation, and where <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> Å¿aith, He Å¿hall baptiÅ¿e you with the Holy Spirit and Fire.

                  <hi>VVere not the Å¿ame PromiÅ¿es contained in</hi> MoÅ¿es <hi>Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> No, neither of them, for you Å¿hall no where find in the Law of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> either Eternall Life, or the holy Spirit promiÅ¿ed to thoÅ¿e that obeyed the Precepts of that Law, as it is apparent that they are promiÅ¿ed in the Law given by ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But it appeareth that there was Å¿ome hope of Eternall Life in the People of God before ChriÅ¿t?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Nothing hinders but that you may hope for Å¿omething, although you have not the PromiÅ¿e of God for the Å¿ame, Å¿o that the thing be very deÅ¿ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and Å¿uch, as it is very likely, that God will give unto thoÅ¿e that Å¿erve him. But neither is any thing more deÅ¿irable then Eternall Life, nor more credible, then that God will beÅ¿tow it upon them that Å¿erve him as the reward, that is Å¿uitable to his perÅ¿on, without which, the other things, though
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:113294:62"/> proceeding from God, are Å¿carce worthy to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Divine reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> And why Å¿o?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> For two reaÅ¿ons, firÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e not Å¿o much the good it Å¿elf, as the perpetuity thereof, Å¿eemeth to have Å¿ome Divinity in it. Next, becauÅ¿e it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that of other good things, except Eternall Life; even thoÅ¿e, and thoÅ¿e chiefly are partakers, who regard not the Å¿ervice of God, yea, blaÅ¿pheme him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Shall they have Eternall Life, who hoped for the Å¿ame, all bough it was not promiÅ¿ed to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, but not all, but thoÅ¿e onely that Å¿erved God with their whole heart, and were obedient to him. For nothing hinders, but that God may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme more then he promiÅ¿ed. And ChriÅ¿t open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth this, when from the words of God he truly and Å¿ubtilly collecteth, that <hi>Abraham, IÅ¿aack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> Å¿hall ariÅ¿e from the dead, and live, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 37, 38. whom the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> imitating, chap. 11. 16. Å¿aith, That God is not aÅ¿hamed of them, to be called their God, for that he hath provided a city for them, and hath decreed that they Å¿hall live for ever with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> If God will give Eternall Life to thoÅ¿e men, why did he not promiÅ¿e it?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> God deferred Å¿o excellent a PromiÅ¿e till a fit time, that it might the more evidently appear to all, that Å¿o excellent a thing is his proper Gift, flowing from his meer bounty.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Are there not in the New Covenant, beÅ¿ides Eternall Life, PromiÅ¿es likewiÅ¿e made concerning this Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Scripture teÅ¿tifieth, that Picty, even under the New Covenant, hath the promiÅ¿e of this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113294:62"/> life, as well as of the life to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And likewiÅ¿e if any man, for the Å¿ake of ChriÅ¿t, and of the GoÅ¿pell, Å¿hall forÅ¿ake all things, that he Å¿hall receive a hundred fold even in this life, with perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and in the world to come, life everlaÅ¿ting, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 29, 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Is the New Covenant, then equall to the Old, as to the promiÅ¿es of this preÅ¿ent life?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Since it appeareth from other places of the Scripture, that a ChriÅ¿tian ought to reÅ¿t in thoÅ¿e things that are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the maintenance of his life, it appeareth that the PromiÅ¿es of this life made under the New Covenant, though in themÅ¿elves very full and plenteous, ought Å¿o to be taken, as that a ChriÅ¿tian Å¿hall not want any thing that is neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily required to the maintenance of this life. But under the Old Covenant it was lawfull, not only to get, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e more then the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of this life did require, but alÅ¿o Å¿uperfluities, pleaÅ¿ures, and other things, without which we may be in this life, Å¿o that this was done without injury to another. Wherefore the promiÅ¿es of this life under the Old Covenant, are not to be reÅ¿trained, but to be taken as the words Å¿ound. Whence likewiÅ¿e it may be Å¿een, that Eternall Life was not promiÅ¿ed under the Old Covenant, otherwiÅ¿e the New would not have better PromiÅ¿es then the Old, contrary to what the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> affirmeth, chap. 8. 6.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> DEclare to me the other PromiÅ¿e, and explain what the Gift of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Gift of the holy Spirit promiÅ¿ed in the New Covenant, is two-fold, the one perpetuall, the other temporary, which was viÅ¿ible, as the firÅ¿t inviÅ¿ible.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat was that temporary and viÅ¿ible Gift?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The gift of doing Miracles, which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was openly given to thoÅ¿e that believed on ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhy did not that Gift alwayes continue?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e it was granted to confirme the New Covenant, which, when it Å¿eemed to God to be Å¿ufficiently confirmed, that Gift by his pleaÅ¿ure and counÅ¿ell ceaÅ¿ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat mean you by theÅ¿e words, namely, That the New Covenant was Å¿ufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> I mean, that thoÅ¿e, who were apt to believe the GoÅ¿pell, had Å¿ufficient ground for their Faith (from what had been done for the confirmation of the Covenant) to all Å¿uceeding times.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But who are thoÅ¿e that are apt to believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Such are endued with honeÅ¿ty of heart, or are at leaÅ¿t, not averÅ¿e therefrom. For it is not in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113294:63"/> will of God, that thoÅ¿e who are otherwiÅ¿e qualified, Å¿hould have no cauÅ¿e to reject the GoÅ¿pel; which would have come to paÅ¿Å¿e, had that confirmation been perpetuall. For there would have been no man found Å¿o wicked, who would not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the doctrine of ChriÅ¿t for true, and have embraced it, not Å¿o much out of a love to piety, and virtue, as out of a deÅ¿ire of that Å¿overain good, which ChriÅ¿t hath promiÅ¿ed to his followers, namely, Eternall Life. Whereby it would have come to paÅ¿Å¿e, that in the ChriÅ¿tian Religion, which by the will and counÅ¿ell of God is to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t from the diÅ¿honeÅ¿t, there would have been no difference between good and bad.</p>

                  <hi>Tell me therefore, what is the Gift of the holy Spirit, which continueth perpetually?</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Before I unfold this, I muÅ¿t demonÅ¿trate, that under the New Covenant, there is a certain Gift of the holy Spirit, which continueth for ever in the Church of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Yea, I deÅ¿ire you to doe Å¿o?</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BeÅ¿ides other teÅ¿timonies, it is evident from thoÅ¿e words of our Saviour himÅ¿elf, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. that God doth, and alwayes will give his holy Spirit to his Children, that begge the Å¿ame of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What is the holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That you may the better underÅ¿tand what the holy Spirit is, conÅ¿ider with your Å¿elf, FirÅ¿t, that in the Scripture of the New Covenant, by the word [Spirit] is Å¿ometimes deÅ¿igned the very GoÅ¿pell of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, partly, becauÅ¿e the things contained therein, are Å¿uch as were revealed by God himÅ¿elf, and could not have been diÅ¿covered by the wit of man; partly, becauÅ¿e it reÅ¿pecteth the Å¿pirit of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:113294:64"/> man, and maketh us Å¿pirituall, which the Law could not do. Hence the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. But now we are freed from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held,: Å¿o that we Å¿erve in newneÅ¿Å¿e of the Spirit, and not in oldneÅ¿Å¿e of the Letter. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. The Law of the Spirit of Life in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, hath freed me from the Law of Sin, and Death. And <hi>ver.</hi> 9. If any man have not the Spirit of ChriÅ¿t, he is none of his. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. the Å¿ame ApoÅ¿tle calleth himÅ¿elf, not a MiniÅ¿ter of the Letter, that is, the Law, but of the Spirit, or New Covenant. Secondly, by the word Spirit, is underÅ¿tood Å¿uch a Gift of God, as is by the Scripture called an EarneÅ¿t, or pledge of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. chap. 5. 5. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1. 14. So that we thereby conceive a firm and certain hope of the Eternall life that is promiÅ¿ed to us, have a kind of taÅ¿te and feeling thereof in our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Do we not perceive a hope of Eternall Life by the very preaching of the GoÅ¿pell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure; for from the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the GoÅ¿pell, a hope of Eternall life therein promiÅ¿ed, may be acquired, otherwiÅ¿e why Å¿hould that Life be there promiÅ¿ed: But to faÅ¿ten, and rivet in our minds a firm and certain hope thereof, by vertue whereof we may continue invincible in all temptations, it Å¿eemeth requiÅ¿ite that that promiÅ¿e outwardly propoÅ¿ed by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pell, Å¿hould be inwardly Å¿ealed in our hearts by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>QueÅ¿t.</label> 
                  <hi>Doth this inward Å¿ealing happen unto all, to whom the outward preaching of the GoÅ¿pell cometh?</hi>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113294:64"/> believe the GoÅ¿pell preached to them, and Å¿o right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uÅ¿e that outward means imployed by God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the promiÅ¿e of Eternall Life. For if that Gift of the holy Spirit, which continued but for a time, was given only to thoÅ¿e that believed the GoÅ¿pell, much more are we to hold, that that Gift of the holy Spirit, which is perpetuall, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to others; but them who have Å¿incerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the GoÅ¿pell, and from their hearts embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Is there not need of the inward Gift of the holy Spirit to believe the GoÅ¿pel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means; for neither do we read in the holy Scriptures, that that Gift is conferred on any one, but him that believeth the GoÅ¿pel. See <hi>John</hi> 7. 38, 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 21, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 7, 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1. 13.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Since you have declared to me what the Gift of the holy Spirit is, I deÅ¿ire you alÅ¿o to declare whether the holy Spirit be a perÅ¿on of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head?</hi>
               </p>

For though we confeÅ¿Å¿e, and exceedingly rejoyce, that our God is wonderfully mercifull, and juÅ¿t, yet we deny that Å¿uch mercy and juÅ¿tice, as the AdverÅ¿aries would here have, is in him by nature. For that mercy is not Å¿o in God by Nature, as they imagine, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauÅ¿e he could not then puniÅ¿h any Å¿in at all: and on the contrary were that JuÅ¿tice in God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they Å¿uppoÅ¿e, he could not forgive any Å¿in at all. In as much as God can never do any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to thoÅ¿e properties that are in him by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For inÅ¿tance, Å¿ince wiÅ¿dome is in God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God never doth any thing contrary thereunto; but whatÅ¿oever he doth, he doth it wiÅ¿ely. But Å¿ince it is evident that God forgiveth Å¿ins, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿heth them when he pleaÅ¿eth; it appeareth that Å¿uch a JuÅ¿tice and Mercy, as they imagine, is not in him by nature, but are only effects of his will. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, that JuÅ¿tice, whereby God puniÅ¿heth Å¿ins, and which the AdverÅ¿aries oppoÅ¿e to Mercy, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

We doe not indeed deny that there is a certain naturall JuÅ¿tice in God, but that is Å¿uch a JuÅ¿tice as is called rectitude, and oppoÅ¿ed to pravity. And this indeed appeareth in all the works of God, (whence they are all juÅ¿t, and right, and perfect) and that no leÅ¿Å¿e, when he forgiveth Å¿innes, then when he puniÅ¿heth them.</p>

                  <hi>DOth it lie in our power to obey God in that manner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, for it is certain, that the firÅ¿t Man was Å¿o created by God, as that he was endued with Free-will. Neither was there any cauÅ¿e why God, after his fall, Å¿hould deprive him thereof. And indeed the JuÅ¿tice of God doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, nor is there any mention of Å¿uch a puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e puniÅ¿hments that God inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Adam</hi> for his tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label>
                  <hi>Is not this Free-wil depraved by Originall Å¿in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> There is no Å¿uch thing as Originall Å¿inne, wherefore neither can it deprave Free-will. For, that Originall Å¿inne cannot be proved out of the Scripture. And the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> being but one act, could not have Å¿uch power as to deprave his own nature, much leÅ¿Å¿e the nature of all his poÅ¿teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But that this puniÅ¿hment was inflicted upon <hi>Adam,</hi> neither doth the Scripture any where relate, and it is altogether unÅ¿uitable to God, who is the fountain of all equity, Å¿o to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>But yet that there is Originall Å¿in, Å¿eemeth to be proved by that teÅ¿timony,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. <hi>All the thoughts of mans heart were only evill, and that continually; and</hi> Gen. 8. 21. <hi>The thought of mans heart is evill from his child-hood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> TheÅ¿e teÅ¿timonies Å¿peak of voluntary Å¿in, Å¿o quireth of them; But a will to perform them is in all men by nature: yet is not that ability Å¿o little, that, if a man will offer violence to himÅ¿elf, he may not by the acceÅ¿Å¿ion of the Divine AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, obey the Divine Will. But God denieth his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:113294:74"/> that Originall Å¿in cannot be proved thence. For as for the firÅ¿t, <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> Å¿heweth that it was Å¿uch a Å¿in, for which it repented God that he had made Man, and he reÅ¿olved to puniÅ¿h him with a Flood; which certainly can by no means be affirmed of Å¿in that is in man by nature, Å¿uch as they think Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Å¿in to be. But in the other teÅ¿timony he Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Å¿in of man Å¿hall not have Å¿uch power, that God for it Å¿hould puniÅ¿h the World with a Flood. which alÅ¿o doth not agree with originall Å¿in.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e all the things pertaining to Religion and Piety would be in us, neceÅ¿Å¿arily and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; and if Å¿o, to what purpoÅ¿e were it to labour, and endeavour, that we might be pious? For all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and diligence, is there Å¿uperfluous, where all things come to paÅ¿Å¿e neceÅ¿Å¿arily, as reaÅ¿on it Å¿elf Å¿heweth. But if the endeavour and Å¿tudy of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Piety be taken away, Religion and Piety it Å¿elf muÅ¿t needs be taken away together.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat abÅ¿urd and horrid things will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God, if this opinion be admitted?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are foure in number; 1. JuÅ¿tice. For it would be manifeÅ¿tly unjuÅ¿t, to puniÅ¿h one for not doing what he was unable to do. But when God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿heth the impious and diÅ¿obedient, what elÅ¿e doth he, then puniÅ¿h them, who do not what they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do. For if the opinion of the AdverÅ¿aries be true, they, by reaÅ¿on of the immutable decree of God cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly become pious and obedient. 2. HypocriÅ¿ie, joyned with deceit: For God having excluded already the greateÅ¿t part of them, to whom the GoÅ¿pel is declared, from Å¿alvation, by his decree, doth notwithÅ¿tanding offer Å¿alvation unto all; and Å¿o doth one thing, and maketh Å¿hew of another, which is the property of Hypocrites and deceivers; And which is worÅ¿e, God doth in Å¿uch a thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:113294:76"/> another is exceedingly circumvented and hurt. 3. Great imprudence; for God would Å¿eem to take care, and endeavour that, which he certainly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cannot come to paÅ¿Å¿e. But what is more fooliÅ¿h and light, then to make a Å¿hew as if you earneÅ¿tly endeavoured to effect that, which you know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be done, and Å¿o to expoÅ¿e your Å¿elf to Å¿corn. 4. Pravity, in that God would be the author of Å¿in. For Å¿ince it is altogether neceÅ¿Å¿ary that Å¿in Å¿hould go before damnation, certainly he that decrees a man Å¿hall be of neceÅ¿Å¿ity damned, decrees alÅ¿o that he Å¿hal of neceÅ¿Å¿ity Å¿in.</p>

Which that it is Å¿o, appeareth from the very poÅ¿ition of the ApoÅ¿tle, which is Å¿uch: Not all, who are born of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleÅ¿h, are truly his Å¿ons, and Å¿uch as to whom the promiÅ¿es of Eternall HappineÅ¿Å¿e, made to the Å¿eed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> doe belong, but only thoÅ¿e, whom God vouchÅ¿afeth that Grace, without any regard had to their birth according to the fleÅ¿h, of which Å¿ort are they that have believed in God through ChriÅ¿t, (of what parents Å¿oever they are deÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and by this means are become the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the Spirit.

Again, it is perÅ¿picuous, that that way of drawing, pertaineth unto all, to whom the declaration of the GoÅ¿pell doth come, as may be eaÅ¿ily collected from that place, where JeÅ¿us Å¿aith, When I am lifted up from the Earth, I will draw all men unto me, <hi>John</hi> 12. 32.</p>

Whereas now the manner of JuÅ¿tification by Faith in ChriÅ¿t, is contained in the very New Covenant. Whence their Faith did not include Faith in ChriÅ¿t, and therefore the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith that Faith came by the GoÅ¿pell, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22, 23, 24, 25.

Next, he delivereth us from the Å¿ervitude of the Å¿ins themÅ¿elves, whilÅ¿t by the Å¿ame authority he withdraweth, and calleth us away from all kind of Å¿innes, by Å¿hewing us in his own perÅ¿on, what he Å¿hall gain, who deÅ¿iÅ¿teth from Å¿inning; or elÅ¿e by exhorting, and warning, and helping, yea, Å¿ometimes by puniÅ¿hing us.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> What is the difference between the expiation of the Old and New Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> That of the New, is more excellent, and that for two reaÅ¿ons chiefly; firÅ¿t, in that the legall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113294:84"/> extended onely to Å¿uch Å¿ins as were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of ignorance, or weakneÅ¿Å¿e: but for greater fins, which were manifeÅ¿t tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions of the Law, no Å¿acrifices were appointed, but the penalty of death was propoÅ¿ed. But if God did remit Å¿uch Å¿ins to any one, that was not done by vertue of the Covenant, but by the Å¿ingular Grace of God, which God beyond the Covenant exhibited when and to whom he liÅ¿ted. But under the New Covenant, not only thoÅ¿e Å¿ins are remitted, which have been acted through ignorance and weakneÅ¿Å¿e, but Å¿uch as are the moÅ¿t open tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions of the Law of God, Å¿o that he, who hath fallen in that manner, do not perÅ¿evere therein, but truly repent, and relapÅ¿e no more into Å¿uch Å¿ins. Secondly, in that under the Old Covenant, the expiation of Å¿ins was Å¿o made, as that the temporary puniÅ¿hment onely was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; whereas the New Covenant exhibites Å¿uch an expiation, as removeth not only the temporary, but the eternall penalties of Å¿ins, and inÅ¿tead of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment, offereth Eternall Life, promiÅ¿ed in the Covenant, to thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e Å¿ins are expiated.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> How do you demonÅ¿trate each of theÅ¿e?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> That the Å¿ins which could not be expiated under the Old Covenant, may be expiated under the New, is teÅ¿tified by <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39. where he Å¿aith, Be it known unto you, brethren, that by this man is remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins declared to you. And from all things, wherefrom ye could not be juÅ¿tified by the Law of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> by Him every one that believeth is juÅ¿tified. The Å¿ame may be Å¿een, <hi>Rom</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. Now that Å¿ins are in Å¿uch a manner expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the New Covenant, as that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall penalty of them is taken away, and Eternall Life given, appeareth from the laÅ¿t place we quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:113294:84"/> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. Where it is Å¿aid, That ChriÅ¿t by his own Bloud, entred once into the Sanctuary, having found Eternall Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> Why is that Sacrifice of ChriÅ¿t performed in the Heavens?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> BecauÅ¿e it required a Tabernacle Å¿uitable both to the PrieÅ¿t, and the Sacrifice. For Å¿ince the PrieÅ¿t is immortall, and his Sacrifice alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incorruptible, it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary that he Å¿hould enter into an Eternall Tabernacle. But in as much as Heaven only is Å¿uch a Tabernacle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Å¿eat and habitation of God, and therefore it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary that he Å¿hould enter into the very Heaven, there to diÅ¿charge his PrieÅ¿tly function, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> plainly teÅ¿tifieth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. and chap. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. and chap. 10. 5, 6, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <label>A.</label> At no hand; for, as you heard even now, the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 8. 4. expreÅ¿ly Å¿aith, that if ChriÅ¿t were upon the Earth, hee would not be a PrieÅ¿t. BeÅ¿ides, for as much as the Å¿ame Author, chap. 2. 17. teÅ¿tifieth, that ChriÅ¿t ought in all things to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mercifull and faithfull High-PrieÅ¿t to God ward, it is evident, that untill he had been made like unto his brethren in all things, that is, in afflictions and death, he was not out mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and faithfull High-PrieÅ¿t. Whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that his afflictions, and death were not his very Sacrifice, but a preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

               <hi>Why doth the Apostle Å¿ay, that ChriÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered himÅ¿elf a Å¿acrifice and offering to God, for a Å¿weet-Å¿melling Å¿avour?</hi> EpheÅ¿. 5. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <label>AnÅ¿w.</label> FirÅ¿t, you muÅ¿t know that we doe not Å¿eparate the death of ChriÅ¿t, and exclude it from his offering, yea we conÅ¿tantly affirme that ChriÅ¿t no otherwiÅ¿e, then by his death, and the intervening thereof, offered himÅ¿elf. Onely we aÅ¿Å¿ert that his offering was not actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated and abÅ¿olved, till being raiÅ¿ed from the dead, he paÅ¿Å¿ed into Heaven. For in that year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿acrifice under the Law, which chiefly Å¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out the Sacrifice of ChriÅ¿t, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the work it was altogether neceÅ¿Å¿ary, that the bloud of the Å¿lain BeaÅ¿t Å¿hould be brought into the Sanctuary by the High-PrieÅ¿t, Å¿ee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7. Again, it is to be conÅ¿idered that the ApoÅ¿tle in the fore-mentioned place doth not Å¿ay, that ChriÅ¿t offered himÅ¿elf to God for us. For this word [delivered] ought not to be joyned with the word [offering] but to be read by it Å¿elf, Å¿o that the Å¿enÅ¿e is, that ChriÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered himÅ¿elf to death. For in that Å¿ignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture elÅ¿ewhere uÅ¿eth the word [de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.] Furthermore, the following words [a Sacrifice and offering to God for a Å¿weet-Å¿mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Å¿avour] are an illuÅ¿tration and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that work of ChriÅ¿t in delivering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf to death, (whereby the ApoÅ¿tle exhorteth the faithfull to imitate that deed of ChriÅ¿t in loving their neighbour.)

                  <label>A.</label> You rightly apprehend the thing. For he that embraceth the Å¿aving Doctrine, is already in the true Church.

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As to the ApoÅ¿tles and Prophets, it is certain that they have no more place in the Church of ChriÅ¿t. For the cauÅ¿e for which they were choÅ¿en and Å¿ent forth by the Lord, is now ceaÅ¿ed; which was, that God by them would have the doctrine of his Son declared and confirmed to the world. And therefore they were called the foundations of the Church of ChriÅ¿t by <hi>Paul, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. 20. Wherefore, after that the GoÅ¿pell of ChriÅ¿t had, according to the counÅ¿ell of God, been abundantly diÅ¿covered to the world, and confirmed, there is no more place left in the Church for Å¿uch perÅ¿ons as Å¿hould any further diÅ¿cover, and confirm the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Why call you the ApoÅ¿tles and Prophets the foundation of the Church, when ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf is the foundation thereof?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 11.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:113294:88"/>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The ApoÅ¿tles and Prophets are called the foundation of the Church in one Å¿enÅ¿e, and ChriÅ¿t is in another the foundation thereof. The one, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reference to other men, who belong to the Å¿ame Church of ChriÅ¿t, and wholly ground themÅ¿elves on the doctrine of the ApoÅ¿tles, and Prophets. And then ChriÅ¿t is conÅ¿idered as Å¿omething greater, that is, as the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tone of that foundation, Å¿ee the forecited place, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. 20. The other, not onely in reference to the reÅ¿t of the Church, but alÅ¿o the very ApoÅ¿tles themÅ¿elves, who are built upon ChriÅ¿t, as well as other Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What Å¿ay you concerning EvangeliÅ¿ts?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That they ceaÅ¿ed together with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles. For they did then with the ApoÅ¿tles preach a New doctrine, which now accounted moÅ¿t Old.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What think you of the other perÅ¿ons?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In as much as their MiniÅ¿tries doe even now continue, the perÅ¿ons themÅ¿elves muÅ¿t alÅ¿o needs continue, as being conÅ¿tituted for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tries Å¿ake.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How are they conÅ¿tituted for the Ministry?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As we have it Å¿et down in the doctrine of the ApoÅ¿tles.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How is that?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Concerning the offices of Doctors, PaÅ¿tors, BiÅ¿hops, and Presbyters, or Elders, the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> at large diÅ¿covereth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A BiÅ¿hop muÅ¿t be unblameable, &amp;c. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 6, 7. &amp;c. A BiÅ¿hop muÅ¿t be unreproveable, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Have not thoÅ¿e who teach in the Church, and keep order therein, need to be Å¿ent in Å¿ome Å¿peciall manner?</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:113294:88"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> By no means; for they doe not now bring a new doctrine, and Å¿uch as was unheard of before, but that of the ApoÅ¿tles, received of old by all men, exhorting men to lead their lives according to it. Whence the ApoÅ¿tle expreÅ¿ly deÅ¿cribing all things, which belong to the conÅ¿tituting of Å¿uch perÅ¿ons, make no mention of any miÅ¿Å¿ion or Å¿end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. NevertheleÅ¿Å¿e when Å¿uch perÅ¿ons according to the preÅ¿cript of the ApoÅ¿tolick Doctrine are conÅ¿tituted, and are endued with thoÅ¿e two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, namely innocency of life, and aptneÅ¿Å¿e to teach, they ought thereupon to have juÅ¿t authority amongÅ¿t all.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>What Å¿ay you to thoÅ¿e words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle,</hi> Rom. 10. 15. <hi>How Å¿hall they preach, unleÅ¿Å¿e they be Å¿ent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The ApoÅ¿tle doth not here Å¿peak of any preaching whatÅ¿oever, but of the preaching of a new Doctrine, and Å¿uch as hath not formerly been heard, of which Å¿ort was the preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles, and their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tants, who therefore had need of a miÅ¿Å¿ion, or Å¿ending. But in as much as at this day there is no Å¿uch preaching, there is alÅ¿o no need of Å¿uch a miÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How ought Deacons to be ordained?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As the ApoÅ¿tles directed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8, 9. Let the Deacons in like manner be grave, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You have handled what pertained to thoÅ¿e that govern, now handle alÅ¿o that which pertaineth to thoÅ¿e that are governed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is their duty to be obedient unto thoÅ¿e that govern, in all thoÅ¿e things, which they preÅ¿cribe according to the Word of God. Concerning which we read in the EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> chap. 13. 17. Next, that they communicate to them that teach
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:113294:89"/> in all good things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. yea, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them double honour, or maintenance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Finally, that an accuÅ¿ation againÅ¿t them be not admitted under two or three WitneÅ¿Å¿es, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
