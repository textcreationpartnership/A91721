            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian READER.</head>
            <p>SEeing it hath pleaſed Almighty God, to bring this good diſcourſe to thy ſight; We are certain waſt thou ſenſible of thy benefit that might redound to thy ſoul upon the Imbracing of the Doctrine therein contained, thou wouldſt not look upon it, as men now a dayes look upon moſt Books, with a careleſſe unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved reſolution, to embrace what ſhall appear to them to be truth; but rather to pleaſe their curious fancy, then nouriſh and refreſh their ſouls with good and wholſome Doctrine, the effects whereof would bring them to happineſs.</p>
            <p>We wilt not here make it our work to plead for the excellency of this Diſcourſe, but leave that to the Book it ſelf. Only our advice to thee is that (ſeeing the things that are therein aſſerted, are built upon plain texts of Scripture, without any conſequencies; and ſeeing its tendancy is ſo much to the propagating of holineſſe (without which no man ſhall ſee God) and likewiſe that it is not the opinion of a particular man onely, but of ſeverall Churches of Jeſus Chriſt)
<pb facs="tcp:113294:4"/> thou wouldſt give the more heed to what thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. Obtain the honour to be like the Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> by ſearching in the Scripture, whether the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein be ſo or not; beg of God, that he would illuminate thy underſtanding, in ſeaching after the truth, and having ſound it, ſear not to own it; God will ſtand by thoſe that ſtand for him, and if he be on thy ſide it's no matter who is against thee; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beg of God more and more to confirm thee in the truth, and ingage him to make thee yet more wiſe, by improving the wiſdome thou hast already obtained.</p>
            <p>Conſider how all along the truth (or at least that which was moſt true) hath been cryed out against and perſecuted under the notion of Error. How was our Lord Jeſus Christ himſelf lookt upon, as a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheamer? Yea, and put to death on that accompt; neither hath the malice of men, reſted in crucifying their Lord, but hath extended much farther, even to the killing his Apoſtles, Prophets and Diſciples, and all upon the ſame ſcore of blaſphemy and Errour.</p>
            <p>What is it that keeps Mahomets Religion in Turkey alive, but that it is death to diſpute it? And what keeps the Popes intereſt up in <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, but inquiſitians and Tortures, which are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on thoſe who deny his ſupremacy, and argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Religion? And what is it that will keep <hi>England</hi> from ever having the knowledge of the truth flouriſh within its Dominion and Terri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ories, but harkening to thoſe that call themſelves miniſters, who rather then they will part with their reputation in the world and their ſat benefices, will cry down the greateſt truths for blaſphemies? as it is too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently in theſe our dayes, otherwiſe how is it, that notwithſtanding our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that will be my diſciple muſt deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe daily, &amp;c.</hi> and through much tribulation
<pb facs="tcp:113294:4"/> we muſt enter into the kingdom of God; they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alter their Religion from Epiſcopacy to Presbytery and to Epiſcopacy (or any other Religion that the state and the generality of men are of) again (ſo they may live at eaſe and have their bodies well pampered) then be a diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt upon ſuch tearms: yea, and rather then they will enter into the kingdom of God through tribulation, or perſecution; they will maintain ſuch a Doctrine, and ſtand up for ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; the profeſſion whereof ſhall never expoſe them to ſufferings for it: Yea and if they cannot maintain it by Scripture or reaſon, they will (as much as in them lies) procure the aſſiſtance of the civil Magiſtrate to enforce it upon the people, though it be against their conſciences: Which if we did but well conſider, is a ſufficient argument to evince the falſeneſſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it being ſo unlike to the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apostles, of whom we never read that they deſired the civill Magiſtrate to protect them, or to establiſh their Religion by force upon the people, for that indeed is but (as beſt) the way to make men hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, in that the moſt of men will rather imbrace a Religion against their conſciences, then ſuffer any thing for religion.</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label>d therefore ſeeing the ſtate of things lyes as we have before declared, how happy will he be whoſe Religion is built upon the Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, <hi>(Jeſus Chriſt being the chief corner ſtone)</hi> that hath the greatest reaſon of its ſide that poſsibly can be imagined; doubtleſſe it will carry him through all difficulties whatſoever.</p>
            <p>That this diſcourſe is ſo, we leave to thy conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, upon thy weighing of what is contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in withall ſeriouſneſſe, and that the truth may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

That they may never harken ſo to our pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as to ſuppreſſe the truth under the Notion of error and blaſphemy; eſpecially ſince they and we have hitherto pretended to ſtand up for the truth, and for liberty in practiſing thereof: That the bleſſing of the Lord may continually attend thee in thy progreſſe upon this account, is and ſhall be the continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of,</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe no ſuſpition can poſſibly creep into the mind concerning thoſe Authors, as if they had not had exact cognizance of the thing which they deſcribed, in that ſome of them were eye and ear-witneſſes of the things which they ſet down, and the others were fully and accurately informed by them concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Why cannot the ſecond?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Inaſmuch as the Chriſtian Religion doth prohibit lying, even in the ſmalleſt matter, it is clear that thoſe Authors, who were not only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but alſo the firſt Doctors of the Chriſtian Religion, could by no means lye, eſpecially in a thing of ſuch importance, as would draw the whole world into error.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Why cannot the third?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Becauſe in theſe books there is no repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no falſity, as by an accurate diſcuſſion of all the places which ſeem to make ſhew of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, might eaſily be made to appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You have ſhown how two cauſes of the four have here no place, ſhew alſo why the third cannot be admitted?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> If the third cauſe had here any place, it muſt be either that thoſe writings have been wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or in part. They could not be wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, for then neither would thoſe be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them, whom we a little before proved to have been the Authors. But if they were corrupted in part, certainly it would either be in thoſe things that are of great moment, or in thoſe that are of ſmall moment. Not in thoſe things that are of great moment, inaſmuch as the corrupted part would betray it ſelf, by being unſuitable to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted ones. But if there be any corruption in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113294:7"/> ſome things of ſlight moment, that neither is nor ought to be of ſo great weight, as to render the credit of the Books ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Can you not alſo prove another way, that the writings of the new Covenant have not been corrupted?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, for it is altogether incredible that God, whoſe goodneſſe and providence are immenſe, hath ſuffered thoſe writings, wherein he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Will, and the way to eternal life, and which through the ſucceſſion of ſo many ages, have by all the godly been received and approved as ſuch, to be any wayes corrupted.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How will you prove that the fourth cauſe hath here no place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You might of your ſelf have obſerved that already, in that there are no fit and ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of credit-worthy men, wherewith thoſe writings may be preſſed or oppugned.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Inaſmuch as you have taught that there is no cauſe why it ſhould be doubted concerning the writings of the new Covenant, teach likewiſe why credence ſhould be given to the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Although this very thing, namely, that there is no juſt cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Even the truth of the Chriſtian religion, which being compriſed in thoſe books and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is evident that credence muſt of neceſſity be given to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But how will you prove to me that the Chriſtian Religion is true?</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113294:7"/>

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Whence doth it appear that the Author of the Chriſtian Religion was a man truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From the truly divine miracles which he wrought. As alſo becauſe having undergone a moſt bitter death in witneſſe of the Religion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him, he was by God raiſed from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How know you that he did miracles, and that thoſe miracles were divine?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is evident that he did miracles, not only from the teſtimony of his Diſciples, but alſo of his profeſſed enemies, ſuch as the Jewes are. And that thoſe miracles were divine you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily acknowledge, when I ſhall have ſhown that he was raiſed from the dead by God. For ſince he affirmed, that he wrought his miracles by the power of God, his Reſurrection from the dead putteth the matter out of queſtion, and conſequently evinceth that his miracles were truly divine.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Shew therefore that he was raiſed from the dead by God?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That he was raiſed from the dead by God, is hence apparent; firſt becauſe there were many preſently after his death, who conſtantly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had ſeen him raiſed from the dead, and for this very reaſon, becauſe they affirmed him to have been raiſed from the dead, they ſuffered many calamities, and ſome loſt their very lives. Again, an innumerable multitude of others recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame from thoſe that went before,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113294:8"/> did upon the ſame ground endure very great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and moſt exquiſite deaths. From whence it followeth neceſſarily, either that Jeſus was raiſed from the dead, or that they by conſtantly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing which they knew to be falſe, did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly involve themſelves in ſo many calamities, and ſo bitter deaths. The latter could by no means come to paſſe, inaſmuch as very common ſenſe doth abundantly refute it; And therefore it is apparent that the firſt is altogether true.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What other argument hereof have you?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Namely, that it is altogether incredible, that ſuch a Religion as brings no worldly ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, commodity or pleaſure to the Profeſſors thereof, but rather robs them of the ſame, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into various ſtraits and afflictions, ſhould be imbraced by ſo many Nations, had it not beene confirmed by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You have ſhown that the Author of the Chriſtian Religion was a divine man; I would alſo have you ſhew, that the very Religion it ſelf is divine?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You may already have perceived, that from the divine Author thereof, nevertheleſſe it may be alſo acknowledged from thoſe things whereof this Religion doth conſiſt, namely from the Precepts and Promiſes thereof; as alſo from all the circumſtances of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How is it gathered from the Precepts and Promiſes that this Religion is divine?</p>
               <p>

                  <label>Q.</label> Why hath man nothing common with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Becauſe he was at firſt formed of the earth, and therefore created mortall.

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label>. But how agreeth this with thoſe places of the Scripture, wherein it is written, that man was created after the image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27. &amp; that death by ſin entred into the world, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 5. 12.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> But can you make this plain by another te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes; by that <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. 20. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113294:11"/> ſaith, That what may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath manifeſted it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For the inviſible things of him from the foundation of the world, being underſtood by his works are ſeen; both his eternall power and divinity; ſo that they are inexcuſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But how appeareth it plainly from that testimony?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Becauſe the Apoſtle affirmeth thoſe things which God hath by the Goſpell diſcovered to men, to be ſuch as were inviſible from the very creation of the world. So that they could by no means be traced out by men. For the very matter, which the Apoſtle in this place propoſeth to be handled, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth that thoſe works, whereby the inviſible things of God were known, are to be underſtood of the works done under the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But that place is commonly interpreted in another ſenſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> I am not ignorant thereof, but that cometh to paſſe, becauſe they read the paſſage otherwiſe then it was written by the Apoſtle. For whereas the Apoſtle wrote, From the creation of the world, they read, By the creation of the world. Again, they joyn the ſame words not with the clauſe going before, (an example of which joyning you have in the 13. of <hi>Mat. ver.</hi> 35. I will open my mouth in parables, I will diſcloſe things hidden from the foundation of the world) but with the clauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, as if the Apoſtle meant that the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of God were ſeen by the Creation of the world.</p>

                  <label>A.</label> To believe that God is perfectly juſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto Salvation, firſt that we may perſwade our ſelves, that God will make good his Promiſes to us, though we be unworthy.

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> This is therefore neceſſary to be known, to the end we might not doubt, that even our very heart, then which nothing is harder to be ſearched out, and from which the chiefeſt eſtimate of our obedience is taken, lieth alwaies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto God.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113294:14"/> that all things are in the hands of God, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions happen not without his will, neither is any thing, either in heaven or on earth, able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his divine power from accompliſhing what he hath promiſed, and we expect from him.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> You have unfolded what things are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known touching the Eſſence of God, and therefore I pray you now diſcover what things are very conducible thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is very conducible hereunto to know that in the eſſence of God there is but one Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Demonſtrate this I pray you.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Inaſmuch as the Eſſence of God is but one in number, there cannot be ſo many perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſince a perſon is nothing but an individuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Eſſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Who is this one divine Perſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That one God, the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <label>A.</label> 
                  <hi>By the moſt evident teſtimonies of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, thus Chriſt himſelf,</hi> Iohn 17. 3. <hi>ſaith,</hi> This is life eternall that they may know thee <hi>(Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi> the onely true God. <hi>And the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, 1 Corinth. 8. 6. <hi>ſaith,</hi> To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all the things, &amp; we for him. <hi>And Epheſ.</hi> 4. 6.

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But Chriſtians commonly hold, that not onely the Father, but alſo the Son, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit are perſons in one and the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know it well, but they are grievouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, producing arguments for it out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ill underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What are their arguments wherewith they endeavour to prove their opinion?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The chief are theſe. Firſt they ſay that the Scripture calleth not only the Father, but alſo the Son, and the Holy Spirit, God; And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the ſame Scripture affirmeth that there is but one God, hence they gather, that theſe Three are that one God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How muſt this Argument be ſolved?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> I will firſt make anſwer concerning the Son, and then concerning the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer will you make concerning the Son?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The word [GOD] is two wayes chiefly uſed in the Scripture. The firſt is, when it deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, who both in the heavens, and on the earth, doth ſo rule and exerciſe dominion over all, that he acknowledgeth no ſuperior, and is ſo the Author and Principall of all things, as that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on none. The other is, when it deſigneth him who hath ſome ſublime dominion from that one God, and ſo is in ſome ſort partaker of his Deïty. Hence is it that the Scripture calleth that one God the <hi>God of Gods,</hi> or moſt <hi>high God. Pſal.</hi> 50. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. And in the latter ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Son of God is in certain places of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture dignified with the title of a God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How prove you that the Son of God is in this latter ſignification dignified with the title of a God?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From the very words of the Son himſelf,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113294:15"/> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 10. 35. <hi>If he call them Gods, to whom the Word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; ſay ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent into the world, Thou blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God?</hi> By this ſpeech Chriſt doth clearly intimate, both that the word [GOD] is ſomtime attributed unto them in the Scripture who are far inferiour to that one God; as alſo that he called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Son of God, and conſequently a God, for no greater reaſon then becauſe he had been ſanctified by the Father, and ſent into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But what anſwer give you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Holy Spirit is no where in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expreſly called God; and though in ſome places the things of God are attributed to him, yet doth it not thereupon follow, that he is either God, or a perſon of the Deity, ſince this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth for another cauſe, as you ſhall hear in in its place.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat is the ſecond argument wherewith they go about to prove the three Perſons in one Deity?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is taken from thoſe places, wherein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhich are thoſe places?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> 
                  <hi>The firſt is that, where Jeſus command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Apoſties to make all Nations Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> baptizing them into the name of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113294:15"/> Father; and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Mat. 28. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond is, that where the Apoſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in this manner.</hi> There are diverſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit. And diverſities of Miniſteries, but the ſame Lord. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Operations, but the ſame God, that operateth all the things in all, 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6. <hi>And afterwards in the eleventh verſe of the ſame chapter, he ſaith,</hi> But all theſe things operateth one and the ſame Spirit, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to every one as he will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third is in</hi> John, 1 Epiſt. 5. 7. There are three that hear witneſſe in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and theſe three are one.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What are we to think of theſe Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In generall I anſwer, that theſe Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations onely ſhew that there is a Father, Sonne, and Holy Spirit, which we not only acknowledge, but conſtantly aſſert, ſo that we pronounce him to be no Chriſtian, who is either ignorant thereof, or doth not believe it. But it is evident that theſe Quotations do not demonſtrate the Father, Sonne, and Holy Spirit to be three Perſons in one Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Yet from ſuch a Conjunction of thoſe three in divine Operations, it ſeemeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what probable that they are three Perſons in one divine Eſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means. For as to the firſt place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113294:16"/> the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in Baptiſm, yet doth it not therefore follow that they are Perſons in one divine Eſſence, both for that it is ſaid in the words immediately going before, that all power in heaven &amp; on earth was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Son, which cannot poſſibly agree to him that is a Perſon in the divine Eſſence; as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no new thing for the Scripture, in other things no leſſe divine then Baptiſm, to joyn with God ſuch Perſons and Things, as no wayes pertain to the divine Eſſence. Of Perſons you have an example in the firſt book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> chap. 12. 18. <hi>And all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.</hi> And in <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 14. 31. where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew it is read, <hi>And the people feared the Lord, and believed in the Lord, and in his ſervant Moſes.</hi> Of things you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace.</hi> &amp; Epheſ. 6. 10. <hi>Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then your ſelves in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But they hold he muſt needs be God, into whoſe name we are baptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are exceedingly miſtaken, for we read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. that the Iſraelites were all baptized into <hi>Moſes.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 3. that certain Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were baptized into the Baptiſme of <hi>John;</hi> Although neither <hi>Moſes</hi> were God, nor the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of <hi>John</hi> a Perſon, much leſſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But it ſeemeth one thing to be baptized into any ones name, and another to be baptized into any one?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means. For by vertue of the Hebrew Idiotiſme, it is oftentimes all one to do ſomething
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113294:16"/> into any ones name, and into any one, as is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known. Neither need we go far for any inſtance, ſince the matter in hand will readily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, for whereas we read in ſome places, that <hi>Diſciples were baptized into the name of Chriſt,</hi> ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 5. we read in others, that they were ſimply baptized into Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer give you to the ſecond Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That although divine operations be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, and to the Lord, and to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet can it not be rightly inferred thence, that theſe three are of one eſſence. Yea the contrary may be thence clearly collected, namely that they cannot be of one eſſence, ſince the Lord and the Holy Spirit are openly diſtinguiſhed from God, whom we formerly proved to be no other then the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But becauſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with God, mention is here made of the Lord, and of the Holy Spirit, this is therefore done, becauſe the Lord is he by whom God doth work all theſe things, with the concurrent miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Holy Spirit, for here he treateth only of thoſe things that appertain unto the faithfull, in whom the Holy Spirit worketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer give you to the third?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Firſt ſince it is known that in the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greek copies, and in the Syriack, and in the more antient Latin Verſions, theſe words are not extant, as the chiefeſt of our Adverſaries do ſhew, nothing certain can be concluded from them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, though they were extant in the Scripture, yet could it not be thence concluded, that there are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113294:17"/> three Perſons in one Divinity. For that place ſpeaketh of no other thing then of witneſſing that Jeſus is the Son of God, or the Chriſt. But that this may be atteſted, not only by ſuch as are divine perſons, but even by ſuch as are no perſons at all, appeareth by the following words, wherein the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that there are three that bear witneſſe on the earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Bloud. Now when he ſaith that the former three are one, that this is meant of their being one in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and agreement, but not in eſſence, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the following verſe, where the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is found, and muſt be taken in ſuch a ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> I perceive by your former diſcourſe, that there is but one Perſon in the divine eſſence, and therefore I would now know how the knowledge hereof is very conducible to ſalvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You will eaſily perceive that, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how pernitious the opinion of the Adverſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is. For firſt, that opinion may eaſily undermine and weaken the belief of one God, whileſt one while it confeſſeth but one God, another while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth three Perſons, every one whereof is that one God. Secondly it obſcureth the glory of that one God, who is only the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, whileſt it transferreth it to another, who is not the Father. Thirdly, it may eaſily pervert the way of ſalvation, whileſt it taketh away the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the firſt and ſecond cauſe thereof, and ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reth us not rightly to acknowledge who is the prime Author of our Salvation and how God manageth the ſame by Jeſus Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit. In ſine, it greatly hindreth Aliens from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113294:17"/> embracing the Chriſtian Religion, whileſt it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth ſuch things as are oppoſite to divine Truth and ſound reaſon. From all which inconveniences that opinion is free which holdeth that there is but one Perſon in the divine eſſence.</p>

               <hi>There are two principall cauſes thereof. The one, that God would have us believe it.

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> I am content. Firſt therefore you muſt know that thoſe things partly concern the Eſſence, partly the Office of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> What are the things that concern his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Perſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Only that he is a true man by nature, as the holy Scriptures frequently teſtifie concerning that matter, and namely, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>There is one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21. <hi>Since by man came death, by man alſo came the Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> And indeed ſuch a one God heretofore promiſed by the Prophets, and ſuch a one the Apoſtles Creed, acknowledged by all Chriſtians, confeſſeth Jeſus Chriſt to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Is the Lord Jeſus then a meer man?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means. For he was conceived of the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is from his very conception and birth the Son of God, as we read, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. where the Angell
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113294:19"/> thus ſpeaketh to the Virgin <hi>Mary, The Holy Spirit ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee, therefore alſo that Holy Thing Generated ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> That I may omit other cauſes, which you ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diſcover in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, and moſt evidently ſhew, that the Lord Jeſus ought by no means to be reputed a meer man.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You ſaid a little before that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is a man by nature, hath he not alſo a divine Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> At no hand; for that is repugnant not onely to ſound Reaſon, but alſo to the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Shew me how it is repugnant to ſound Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Firſt, becauſe two ſubſtances indued with oppoſite properties, cannot combine into one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſuch properties are mortality and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; to have beginning, and to be without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; to be mutable, and immutable. Again, two Natures, each whereof is apt to conſtitute a ſeverall perſon, cannot be huddled into one Perſon. For inſtead of one, there muſt of neceſſity ariſe two perſons, &amp; conſequently become two Chriſts, whom all men without controverſie acknowledge to be one, and his Perſon one.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But when they alledge that Christ is ſo conſtituted of a divine and humane Nature, as a man is of a body and ſoul, what anſwer muſt we make to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That in this caſe there is a wide difference; for they ſay that the two Natures in Chriſt are ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Chriſt is both God and Man. Whereas the ſoul and body in a man are ſo conjoyned, as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113294:19"/> that a man is neither ſoul nor body. For neither doth the ſoul nor the body ſeverally conſtitute a Perſon. But as the divine Nature doth by it ſelf conſtitute a Perſon, ſo muſt the humane by it ſelf of neceſſity alſo conſtitute.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> Shew how it is alſo repugnant to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that Christ ſhould have a divine Nature.</p>
               <p>

Secondly, the ſame Scripture witneſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is a man by nature, as was formerly ſhown. Thirdly, becauſe whatſoever divine excellency Chriſt hath, the Scripture teſtifieth that he hath it by gift of the Father. <hi>John</hi> 3. 35. <hi>John</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27. <hi>John</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26, 27. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. Finally, becauſe the Scripture doth moſt evidently ſhew, that Jeſus Chriſt doth perpetually aſcribe all his Divine acts not to himſelf, or any Divine nature of his own, but to the Father; who ſeeth not that ſuch a Divine nature as the Adverſaries imagine in Chriſt, would have been altogether idle, and of no uſe?</p>

Since therefore the ſubject matter here is the Goſpel, which <hi>Iohn</hi> undertook to deſcribe, without queſtion by the word [begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning] he underſtood the beginning of the Goſpel. This will further appear if you compare <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23.

                  <label>A.</label> Very elegant: For Chriſt admoniſheth the Jewes, who went about to catch him in his words, that whilſt they had opportunity they ſhould believe him to be the Chriſt, or Light of the world, before the Divine Grace, that Chriſt offered to them, was taken away from them, and tranſlated to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Now that thoſe words, <hi>[I am he]</hi> are to be ſupplyed in the ſame manner, as if he had ſaid, <hi>[I am the Christ]</hi> will appear by comparing <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:113294:21"/> 13. 6. with <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 5. See alſo <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 24. 28. Again, that thoſe words, <hi>[Before he become</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham] do ſignifie what we have ſaid, may be diſcovered by the meaning of the word <hi>Abraham,</hi> which as the Scripture, <hi>Gen:</hi> 17. 5. doth hint, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Father of many Nations. Wherefore ſince <hi>Abraham</hi> did not become <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed, that is, a Father of many Nations, until the grace of God manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt, redounded unto many Nations, in that he was before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of but one Nation, it is apparent that the meaning of theſe words, which we have brought, is genuine and true.</p>

                  <label>A.</label> That you may the better perceive the thing, you muſt know that the Adverſaries reaſon from this place in this manner. The Wiſdome of God was begotten from eternity. Chriſt is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. Therefore he was begotten from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. That this argument is invalid appeareth hence: Firſt becauſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of wiſdome ſimply and abſolutely conſidered, without addition of the word [God,] but <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. whoſe words they are wont to confer with thoſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> doth not ſpeak of wiſdome ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but with addition of the word [God.] 2 By wiſdome ſundry Expoſitors, whom the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelves account to be Orthodox, do not conceive that a true and real perſon is meant; but onely that a feigned perſon is here aſcribed to Wiſdome, and it brought in ſpeaking like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Thirdly, though we ſhould admit, that by Wiſdome is underſtood a perſon yet what hinders but that we may with far greater probability under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the holy Spirit, who is called the Spirit of Wiſdom, and hath the ſame things attributed to him, that are aſcribed to Wiſdome; ſee <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. 4, 5. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. compared with <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 12, 14, 15, 16, 20. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. compared with <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 29, 30. Where it is obſervable, that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribing the Creation of the world, maketh mention of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, but not of the Son of God; who was as worthy to have been mentioned, and would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly have been expreſſed, had he been then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113294:23"/> preſent with God, as well as the Spirit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it be amiſſe to cite the concurrent ſuffrages of holy men under the Old Covenant, whoſe writings though put out of the Canon, as not found in the Hebrew, are yet deſervedly of great eſteem among the people of God. For it is apparent from ſundry paſſages, both of the book of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and that of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> that theſe Writers, as they by wiſdome underſtood a creature, ſo did they conceive that creature to be the Spirit of God. See <hi>Wiſdome</hi> 6. 24, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 24. 12, 13, 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. Fourthly thoſe words <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 23. which are rendred <hi>from everlaſting]</hi> are in the Hebrew <hi>à ſeculo,</hi> from the age, or from of old. But it is one thing to be <hi>à ſeculo,</hi> from the age, or from of old, and <hi>ab aeterno</hi> from everlaſting. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Luke.</hi> 1. 70.</p>

                  <label>A.</label> The ſeventh runneth thus, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Spirit hath made you Biſhops, to rule the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud.</hi> Act. 20. 28. Whereunto I anſwer, that the name <hi>(God)</hi> is not here referred to Chriſt, but to God the Father, who is from the beginning of the ſpeech perpetually underſtood by the name of God, and whoſe bloud the Apoſtle calleth that bloud which Chriſt did ſhed, in ſuch a way of ſpeaking, and for

                  </gap> cauſe, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That he which toucheth the people of God, toucheth the apple of Gods Eye.</hi> For the exceeding great conjunction that is between God the Father and Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be different in Eſſence, cauſeth the bloud of Chriſt to be called the bloud of God the Father, eſpecially if it be conſidered as ſhed for us. For Chriſt is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world: Whence the bloud ſhed to that purpoſe, is called the bloud of God himſelf, and that deſervedly. Neither is it to be paſſed by, that in the Syriack Edition it is not read <hi>(God)</hi> but <hi>(Chriſt.)</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The eighth runs thus, <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us,</hi> 1 John 3. 16. Firſt therefore you muſt know, that in no Greek edition, ſave the Complutenſian; nor in the Syriack Tranſlation is the word <hi>(God)</hi> read. But though this word were read in all copies, ſhould therefore the word <hi>(He)</hi> be referred to God? At no hand. Not only for the forementioned reaſon, in anſwer to the third teſtimony, namely that relatives are not alwaies referred to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons next going before, but alſo becauſe <hi>John</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the word <hi>(He)</hi> ſundry times in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to him that was a great while before named, as in the 29. verſe of the foregoing chapter, where he ſaith, <hi>If ye know that he is just, know that he that doth juſtice is generated of him.</hi> Where by <hi>(him)</hi> as both the thing it ſelf, and the following words ſhew, is meant the Father, although in the words next going before mention had been made of Chriſt only?</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You have given me ſatisfaction as to the names of Chriſt. I would now therefore have you explain thoſe quotations that have reſpect to the works of Chriſt, which the Adverſaries ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine are aſcribed to him by the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are ſuch, wherein they imagine the Scripture attributeth unto Chriſt, that he created the heaven and the earth; that he conſerveth all created things; that he brought the people of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he was with them in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe conducting them, and doing good to them, that his glory was ſeen by <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.</p>

                  <hi>Even theſe, where it is written,</hi> That all things were made by him, and without him nothing made, that was made, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>And again,</hi> That the world was made by him, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>And again,</hi> That all things were created by him, that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers; all things were created by him, and for him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16.

                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer give you to the firſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In the firſt teſtimony, the words may be as well rendered <hi>(all things were done by him)</hi> as <hi>(all things were made by him.)</hi> For the Greek word ſignifieth the one as well as the other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in Engliſh there is ſome difference between being made and being done, inaſmuch as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the language admitteth the one many times to be uſed, where the other would not have place. Again, the Evangeliſt ſaith <hi>(all things were done by him)</hi> which kind of ſpeaking deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetl. not the firſt; but the ſecond cauſe. In fine, the word <hi>(all)</hi> is not here taken for all things ſimply and abſolutely, but is reſtrained to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter, which is a thing moſt frequent in the Holy Sriptures, eſpecially that of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a ſingular example whereof you have 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. wherein it is treated of a matter altogether like to that which <hi>Iohn</hi> here ſpeaketh of, and it is ſaid, that <hi>all things are become new;</hi> when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is certain, that there are many things which have not been made new. Wherefore ſince the ſubject matter in <hi>Iohn</hi> is the Goſpell, it appeareth that the word <hi>(all)</hi> ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all thoſe things which any wayes belong to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Why did Iohn add, that without him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done that hath been done?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The better to illuſtrate thoſe foregoing words, (namely, <hi>all things were done by him)</hi> which ſeem to have ſuch force, as if all thoſe things had been done by the Word, or Son of God onely, though ſome things, and thoſe of great moment,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113294:27"/> were not immediately done by him, but by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; of which ſort is the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the abolition of the legall Ceremonies. For though theſe things had their beginning from the words and deeds of the Lord Jeſus, yet were they not brought to an iſſue by Chriſt himſelf, but by his Apoſtles, yet not without him; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles mannaged all things in his name and by his authority, as the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15: 7. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the ſecond?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Firſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> doth not here ſay, that the world was created, but made by him. Again, he uſeth the ſame form of ſpeech, deſigning the ſecond or middle cauſe, for he ſaith not that he made the world, but that the <hi>world was made by him.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the word <hi>[world,]</hi> as well as others, that are equivalent in the Scriptures, doth not only denote the heaven and earth, but beſides other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, deſigneth either manking, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent place ſheweth, where it is ſaid, <hi>That he was in the world, and the world acknowledged him not;</hi> or <hi>the world to come,</hi> as appeareth from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 6. where we read, that <hi>when he bringeth the firſt-born into the world, he ſaith, And let all the Angells of God worſhip him;</hi> which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the world to come, as appeareth from the ſecond chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, verſe fifth, where the Author ſaith, <hi>For he hath not put the world to come, whereof we speak, in ſubjection to Angells.</hi> But he no where ſpake of that world, but in the ſixth Verſe of the former chapter. Beſides, you have another place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 5. where ſpeaking of Chriſt he ſaith, <hi>Wherefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:113294:28"/> 
                  <hi>into the world he ſaith, ſacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body thou hast fitted me.</hi> Where ſince it is apparent that the Author ſpeaketh of that world, into which Chriſt being entred; became a Prieſt, and made his offering (as all the circumſtances of the place do ſhew) it muſt needs be that he ſpeaketh not of this world, but of the world to come, ſince in the eighth chapter verſ. 4. he had ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That if he were on the earth, he would not ſo much as be a Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What underſtand you by this expreſſion, The world was made by him?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> A double ſenſe thereof may be given; firſt, that mankind was reformed, and as it were made again by Chriſt, becauſe he brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to men, who were loſt, and ſubject to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death: (which thing <hi>Iohn</hi> upbraideth the world with, namely that being vindicated from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by Chriſt, yet did it not acknowledge him, but deſpiſe and reject him.) For it is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Hebrew ſpeech, that in ſuch forms of ſpeaking, the words <hi>[make</hi> and <hi>create]</hi> be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with <hi>[make anew,</hi> and <hi>create anew]</hi> inaſmuch as that tongue is deſtitute of compounded verbs. The latter ſenſe is, that the world to come, which we expect by Chriſt, is by him made, as to us; as the ſame is ſaid to be come in reſpect of us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be already preſent to Chriſt, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the third?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That this teſtimony alſo ſpeaketh of Chriſt, as of a ſecond and middle cauſe; and the word <hi>(Create)</hi> as in the Scripture uſed not only of the Old, but alſo of the New Creation, an inſtance
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:113294:28"/> whereof you have, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>For we are his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,</hi> (or making, as the Greek hath it) <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto</hi> (or rather, upon condition of) <hi>good works.</hi> And a little after verſe 15. <hi>For to make in himſelf, of twain, one new man,</hi> (in the Greek, For to create in himſelf the twain into one new man.) Beſides, that thoſe words, <hi>(all things in the heaven, and on the earth)</hi> are not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for all things ſimply and abſolutely, appeareth both by the article in the Greek ſet before the word <hi>(all)</hi> to limit it, and alſo by the collation of the words put a little after in the 20. verſe, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That by him God hath reconciled all the things that are both in the heavens, and on the earth;</hi> and finally by the inſpection of the very words themſelves, wherein the Apoſtle ſaith not, that the heaven and earth were created by Chriſt, but all the things that are in the heavens, and on the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How then underſtand you this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That after God had raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and given glory to him, all the things both in the heavens, and on the earth, were by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and reduced to another ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that he became the Head of Angells and Men, who before acknowledged God only for their Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the fourth testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That it is not here ſaid, that the Son made the world, but God made it by the Son. Now that the word <hi>(world)</hi> may not only ſignifie that which is paſt and preſent, but alſo that which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113294:29"/> is to come, is confeſſed. And that it is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the world to come, is evident from hence, namely that the ſame Author affirmeth, that by him, whom God hath appointed heire of all things, the world was made. For Jeſus of Nazareth was not appointed heire of all things, before God had raiſed him up from the dead, which is apparent, becauſe then at length all power in heaven and earth was given to him by God the Father, in the donation of which power, and not in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that inheritance of all things is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer you to the fifth?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> This teſtimony doth not expreſly ſpeak of Chriſt, but of God. But foraſmuch as this divine Author doth apply it unto the Son of God, it is to be conſidered, that the words expreſly ſpeak, not of one thing, but of twain chiefly: The one whereof is the creation of heaven and earth; the other is the abolition of the things created. Now that this Author doth not referre the firſt unto Chriſt, is from hence apparent, namely becauſe he propoſed to himſelf to demonſtrate, not that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſt, which he hath from himſelf, but that which he obtained by inheritance, and whereby he was made better then Angells, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from the fourth verſe of this firſt chapter of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> of which kind of excellency ſince the creation of heaven and earth neither is, nor can be, it is evident that this teſtimony was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to prove that Chriſt created the heaven and earth. Since therefore the firſt cannot be referred to Chriſt, it is apparent that the latter only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to him; and that therefore, becauſe God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113294:29"/> will aboliſh both the heaven and earth by Chriſt, <hi>when he judgeth the world by him.</hi> Wherein the excellency of Chriſt ſhall ſo far ſurpaſſe that of Angels, that the very Angels ſhall therein miniſter to him. Which latter ſpeech, ſince it could not be underſtood without the words going before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mention is made of the heaven and earth, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is joyned to them by the word <hi>(they)</hi> the author was therefore neceſſitated to repeat them alſo. For if other ſacred Writers do in that manner cite teſtimonies of the Scripture, when they are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with no neceſſity, much more ought this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſo to do, when he was neceſſitated thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Where do ſacred VVriters do ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Amongſt many other teſtimonies you have that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 18, 19, 20, 21. Where it is very evident that the 19. v. only pertaineth to the purpoſe of the Evangeliſt, ſince his intention was to ſhew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Chriſt would not have himſelfe be made manifeſt. Again, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the 17. &amp; 18. ver. only make to the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, which is to ſhew that the H. Spirit was pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon the Diſciples; and in the ſame ch. v. 25 26, 27, 28. where it is clear that the 27. ver. only is ꝑertinent to the buſineſſe in hand, ſince the Apoſtle intendeth to prove that Chriſt could not be detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by death. Finally in this very ch. to the <hi>Heb.</hi> v 9. where it is apparent that theſe words, <hi>(Thou lovedſt righteouſneſſe, and hatedſt iniquity)</hi> are not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to what the divine Author goeth about to prove, namely that Chriſt is made better then Angels.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From that place <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. where it is ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt upholdeth all things by the word of his power.</hi>

                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to this testimony?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That the word <hi>[all]</hi> in this, as well as in other places, doth not deſigne all things without exception, but is referred to thoſe things only that pertain to the Kingdom of Chriſt, as the Article in the Greek ſet before the word <hi>[all]</hi> to limit it, doth ſufficiently declare, ſhewing that it is to be underſtood only of all the things of a certain kind. Beſides, the Greek word which is by the Engliſh Tranſlators rendered <hi>(upholding)</hi> ought to have been rendered <hi>(carrying)</hi> which hath rather the ſignification of ordering and mannaging, then of conſerving, as that which is annexed, [namely, <hi>by the word of his power]</hi> ſeemeth to intimate.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> By what teſtimony prove they that Chriſt brought the children of Iſrael out of Egypt?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Out of <hi>Iude</hi>'s Epiſtle verſ. 5. <hi>Ieſus, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaved the people out of Egypt, did the ſecond time deſtroy them that believed not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer make you hereunto?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That the word <hi>(Ieſus)</hi> is extant in no Greek copie, but inſtead thereof the word <hi>(Lord)</hi> is here read: ſo that this teſtimony no whit proveth what the Adverſaries intend.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But whence prove they that Chriſt was with the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, and conducted them, and did good to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From that paſſage of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4 <hi>They all drank the ſame ſpirituall drink, for they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drank of the ſpirituall rock that followed them; but that rock was Chriſt.</hi> As alſo from the 9. ver. of the ſame chap. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them tempted, and periſhed by Serpents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer give you to theſe places?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As to the firſt, the Apoſtle doth not at all ſay,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113294:30"/> that Chriſt was in the wilderneſſe with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and did good to them. For though he write that the Rock, whereof the people drank, was Chriſt, yet doth not he therefore aſſert that Chriſt was indeed there, becauſe thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> may be figuratively taken. Now whereas he calleth that Rock ſpirituall, this doth nothing advantage the cauſe of the adverſaries, ſince that Rock may be called ſpirituall, although it were Indeed materiall, for the ſame cauſe that the meat was called ſpiritual, namely in that it contained in it a myſtical ſenſe, as in the Revelation <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the great City, where our Lord was ſlain, is ſpiritually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sodom and Egypt, Rev.</hi> 11. 8. Moreover in that he faith, <hi>that the Rock followed them,</hi> it is to be underſtood of the water iſſuing out of the Rock, and following the people through the wilderneſſe, which before was deſtitute of running water, or at leaſt of ſuch as was potable. To which <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> 43. 20. doth allude, where he ſaith, <hi>The beast of the field ſhall honour me, the Dragons, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriches; for I have given them waters in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and rivers in the deſert; to give drink to my people, my Choſen.</hi> As for the ſecond teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, namely, <hi>Let us not tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them tempted:</hi> From theſe words likewiſe it can not be ſhown that Chriſt was indeed tempted in the wilderneſſe. For inſtance, ſhould any man ſay, let us not be refractory to the Magiſtrate, as ſome of our Anceſtors were: it could not thence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the ſame numericall Magiſtrate is in both places deſigned. Now if there be found in the Scriptures ſuch kinds of ſpeaking, wherein the like ſpeech is referred to him, (whoſe name was a little before expreſſed) without any repetition of the ſame perſon, this hap'neth in ſuch a place, where no other,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113294:31"/> beſides him whoſe name was expreſſed, can poſſibly be underſtood, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedſt in Maſſah.</hi> But in this ſpeech of the Apoſtle, whereof we ſpeak, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other then Chriſt may be underſtood, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Angel, &amp;c. ſee <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> From what place prove they that the glory of Chriſt was ſeen by Iſaiah?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Firſt, that theſe words are not of neceſſity to be referred to Chriſt, inaſmuch as they may be referred to God the Father. For the words that are ſet a little before, are ſpoken of the ſame; namely he hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts. Again, the glory which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw, might be, yea was, not a preſent, but a future glory. For it is proper to Prophets to ſee the things that are to come. Whence likewiſe they were called <hi>Seers,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. Finally, although you underſtand theſe words of that glory which was then preſent, and ſeen by <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> yet is it one thing to ſee one's glory, another thing to ſee himſelf; for in the glory of that one God, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> likewiſe ſaw the glory of the Lord Chriſt, for the Prophet there ſaith, <hi>The earth is full of the glory of the Lord.</hi> Which thing was then accompliſhed, when Jeſus Chriſt firſt appeared to the people of the Jewes, and afterwards was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the whole world.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label>From what teſtimonies of Scripture do they endeavour to demonſtrate that Chriſt was (as they ſay) incarnated?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> 
                  <hi>From</hi> Iohn 1. 14. <hi>where according to their Tranſlation it is read,</hi> The Word was made fleſh. <hi>And from</hi> Phil. 2. 6, 7. Who <hi>(Chriſt Jeſus)</hi> being in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113294:31"/> the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God, But made himſelf of no reputation, taking upon him the form of a ſervant, being made in the likeneſſe of men. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, &amp;c. <hi>&amp; from</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. Great is the mystery of godlineſs, God was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fleſh. <hi>And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> Heb. 2. 16. For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels: but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham. <hi>And from</hi> 1 Ioh. 4. 3. Every ſpirit that confeſſeth Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh is of God. <hi>And laſtly from</hi> Heb. 10. 5. Wherfore entring into the world, he ſaith, Sacrifice &amp; offering thou wouldest not, but a body haſt thou prepared for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the firſt teſtimony?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That it is not there ſaid that God was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, or that the divine Nature aſſumed a humane. For it is one thing to ſay, <hi>The Word was made fleſh,</hi> another, that <hi>God was incarnated</hi> (as they ſay) or that the divine Nature aſſumed a humane. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, theſe words <hi>(The Word,</hi> or rather, <hi>the Speech was made fleſh)</hi> may and ought to be thus rendred <hi>(The Word was fleſh.)</hi> Thus the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is rendred verſe 6. of this very chapter. <hi>There was a man ſent by God, his name</hi> John. And <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 19. <hi>Who was a Prophet great in word and deed.</hi> And theſe places, with ſundry others, ſhew that it may be ſo rendred. But that it ought to be ſo rendred, the order of the Evangeliſts words ſufficiently teacheth, for it would have been incongruous to have ſaid, <hi>that the Word was made fleſh,</hi> that is, (as the adverſaries would have it) aſſumed a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, after he had already ſpoken thoſe things of the Word, which followed the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jeſus Chriſt, as namely that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> gave teſtimony of him; that he was in the world; <hi>that his own received him not; that to</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:113294:32"/> 
                  <hi>them who received him, he gave power to become the Sons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How is that to be underſtood that the Word was fleſh?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That he by whom God perfectly revealed his whole will, and who had been therefore by <hi>John</hi> called the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Speech,</hi> was a man, of the ſame conſtitution with others, and ſubject to the ſame infirmity, afflictions and death. For in this ſenſe the Scripture uſeth the word <hi>(fleſh)</hi> as appeareth from thoſe places, where God ſaith, <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man, for that he alſo is fleſh, Gen.</hi> 6. 3. And <hi>Peter</hi> out of <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> ſaith, <hi>All fleſh is graſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the third?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is one thing to ſay that Jeſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of God, took the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: and that the Divine Nature aſſumed a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. For here the form of God cannot deſign the Divine Nature, in that the Apoſtle writeth that Chriſt emptied himſelf of that form. But God can by no means empty himſelf of his nature. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the form of a ſervant denote a humane nature, ſince to be a ſervant is referred to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and condition of a man. But neither is it to be concealed, that the writings of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth uſe the word <hi>(form)</hi> elſwhere but once, namely <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 12. and that in ſuch a ſenſe, wherein not the nature, but exteriour faſhion is ſignified, whileſt, it ſaith that Jeſus appeared to two of his Diſciples in another form.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But from thoſe words, which the Apostle preſently after ſubjoyns, namely He was found in faſhion of a man, doth it not appear that he was (as they ſay) incarnated?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> At no hand. For it is ſaid of <hi>Sampſon, Judg.</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:113294:32"/> 16. 7. 11. that if ſuch and ſuch a thing was done to him, <hi>he ſhould become as a man.</hi> And <hi>Aſaph, Pſa.</hi> 82. denounceth to thoſe, whom he had called Gods, &amp; Sons of the moſt high, that they <hi>ſhould die like men,</hi> notwithſtanding it is certain it cannot be ſaid, that they were (as the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſay) incarnated.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But how do you underſtand this whole place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Thus; that Chriſt, who converſed in the world as God, doing the works of God, and receiving divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, did, when God ſo willed, and the ſalvation of man required, become as a ſervant and vaſſall, and as one of the vulgar men, when he of his own accord ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be bound, whipt, and crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the third?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Firſt that in many ancient copies, and in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tranſlation, the word <hi>(God)</hi> is not here found; ſo that nothing certain can be concluded out of this place. Again, though we read the word <hi>[God]</hi> there, yet is there no cauſe, why it ſhould not be referred to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince it may of him be affirmed, that he was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in Chriſt and the Apoſtles, who were fleſh. And though it be afterwards, according to the vulgar tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, read, that <hi>he was received up into glory,</hi> yet is it in the Greek, <hi>he was received in glory,</hi> that is, with glory, or gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What then is the ſenſe of this place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That you may the better perceive it, I will cite the whole. Thus therefore the Apoſtle ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, <hi>God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in fleſh, was justified in ſpirit, was ſeen of Angels, was preached to the Gentiles, was believed in the world, was received in glory.</hi> The meaning of all which is this. The Chriſtian Religion is full of myſteries. For God, that is, the divine Will touching the ſalvation of men, was perfectly diſcovered by weak and mortall men, and yet notwithſtanding by reaſon of the miracles wrought by the ſpirit in confirmation of the Goſpel, it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113294:33"/> for true. The ſame was at length perceived by the Angels themſelves, &amp; preached not only to the Jews, but alſo to the Gentiles, and not only generally believed, but entertained with the greateſt glory and magnificence.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the fourth?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In it there is not ſo much as a reſemblance of an Incarnation, ſince the divine Author doth not ſay <hi>(took)</hi> but <hi>[taketh,]</hi> nor <hi>(humane nature,)</hi> but the ſeed, that is, the poſterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And indeed to ſhew the invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the argument taken from this place, there needs no more then to conſult the various reading of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Tranſlators, ſet in the margin.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What then is the ſenſe of this place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The meaning of the Author is, that Chriſt is not the Saviour of Angels but men, who being ſubject to afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; leath (which thing he before expreſt by the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of fleſh &amp; bloud) therfore Chriſt of his own accord ſubmitted himſelf to the ſame, that he might free the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full from the fear of death, and ſuccour them in all their afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the fifth?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Here likewiſe is nothing to aſſert the incarnation (as they term it.) For wheras it is read in the ordinary Bibles, <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth Jeſus to be come in the fleſh, is of God.</hi> The Greek hath it, <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth Ieſus Chriſt come in fleſh,</hi> or, <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth Ieſus, come in fleſh, to be Chriſt.</hi> That is, <hi>Every ſpirit is of God, that confeſſeth Ieſus,</hi> who diſcharged his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie on the earth, without any worldly pomp &amp; oſtentation in the moſt humble manner, as to his outward preſence, &amp; with the greateſt contempt, &amp; finally indured a moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death, to be the Chriſt, or King of the people of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat ſay you to the ſixth?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Here alſo is no mention of any Incarnation, ſince the world whereinto this Author here ſaith, that Chriſt entred
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:113294:33"/> to performe his offering, is (as hath been formerly ſhown) the vvorld to come. Whence to enter into the world, doth not here ſignifie to be born; but to paſſe into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Again, by body, in thoſe words <hi>(A body haſt thou prepared me)</hi> may be underſtood an immortall one.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What then is the ſenſe of the place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That God, while Jeſus was entring into heaven, furniſhed him with ſuch a body, as was very ſuitable &amp; fit to diſcharge his Prieſtly Office.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> You have hitherto explained the places of Scripture, from whence they endeavour to prove that which is not found there: I entreat you therefore now to alledge thoſe places from whence they draw wrong concluſions?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Scriptures from whence they draw their wrong concluſions, either directly concern Chriſt, or are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him by a certain accommodation.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are ſuch, wherein Chriſt is called either a God, or one with God, or equall to God, or the Son of the living God, or the proper or only begotten Son of God; or the firſt born of every creature, or having all things that the Father hath, or the Father of eternity, or the Word of God, or the Image of the Inviſible God, or the Character of his ſubſtance, or he, who being ſeen, the Father is ſeen, or in whom the fulneſſe of Deity dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth bodily, or that had glory with the Father before the world was, or whoſe Spirit was in the Prophets, or that came down from heaven, came out from the Father, and came into the world, was ſent by the Father into the world, or the only Lord, Lord of Glory, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and to whom Faith and divine honor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth.</p>

                  <hi>In what places of the Scripture is the word</hi> (God) <hi>attributed to Chriſt?</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to theſe paſſages?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That it cannot from thence be demonſtrated that Chriſt had (as the adverſaries ſpeak) a Divine Nature, may (to omit what hath been formerly ſpoken) be made appear from hence, namely that it is ſpoken in the firſt teſtimony touching ſuch a word as was with God. In the ſecond, <hi>Thomas</hi> calleth him his God, in whoſe hands and feet he found the prints of the nails, and in his ſide the print of the ſpear. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he, <hi>who was of the Fathers according to the fleſh, was over all a God to be bleſſed for evermore.</hi> All which it is cleer cannot poſſibly be ſaid of him that is God by Nature. For from the firſt it would follow, that there are two Gods, whereof the one was with the other. As for the other twain, namely to have the prints of wounds, and to be of the Fathers, do altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a man, which that they ſhould be aſcribed to him that is God by Nature, is very abſurd. But if any one to cloak the buſineſſe pretend the diſtinction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we have formerly removed that, and taught that this diſtinction is not to be endured.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Where doth the Scripture teach that Christ is one with the Father?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> John 10. 29. 30. <hi>Where the Lord ſaith,</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that gave me the ſheep is greater then all, and none can ſnatch them out of the Fathers hand.</p>
               <p>I and my Father are one.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to this proof?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> When it is ſaid that Chriſt is one with the Father, it cannot be thence evinced that he is one with him in Nature, as the words of Chriſt himſelf ſpoken to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Diſciples to demonſtrate: ſee <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep them in thy name whom thou haſt given to me, that they may be one, as we are one.</hi> And afterwards v. 22
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113294:34"/> 
                  <hi>The glory which thou haſt given me have I given them, that they may be one as we are one.</hi> Now that Chriſt is one with the Father, this ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of unity or oneneſſe in will or power, as to the buſineſſe of mans Salvation. Yea that the Divine Nature of Chriſt cannot be proved out of that place, is evident from the place it ſelf, where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Father is greater then all,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently then the Son, as the Son himſelf elſwhere confeſſeth, <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. and that he gave thoſe ſheep to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But where doth the Scripture call him equal to God?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> John 5. 18. Therefore the Iewes ſought the more to ſlay him, in that he had not only broken the Sabbath, but alſo called God his own Father, making himſelf equall to God. <hi>And</hi> Phil. 2. 6. Who <hi>(Chriſt Jeſus)</hi> being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What anſwer you to thoſe places?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That Chriſt is equall to God no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a Divine Nature in him, yea the contrary is hence collected. For if Chriſt be equall to God, who is God by Nature, he cannot poſſibly be the ſame God. But the equality of Chriſt with God herein conſiſteth, that by the power which God conferred on him, he did all thoſe things (and will do them) which pertain to God himſelf, as if he were very God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Where read we that Chriſt is the Son of the living God, the proper and only begotten Son of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> 
                  <hi>Of the firſt we read,</hi> Mat. 16. 16: <hi>where</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſaith,</hi> Thou art the Son of the living God. <hi>And</hi> Rom. 8. 32. <hi>where the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Who <hi>(God)</hi> ſpared not his own proper Son, but delivered him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113294:35"/> for us. <hi>And</hi> Iohn 3. 16. So God loved the world, that he hath given his only begotten Son, <hi>and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after v.</hi> 18. He that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What do you anſwer to theſe places?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> From all thoſe attributes cannot be proved any Divine Nature of Chriſt. For as to the firſt, it is apparent that <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſeth the Son of Man to be the Chriſt, the Son of the living God, who it is certain had not a Divine Nature, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Again, the Scripture teſtifieth of other men, that they are Sons of the living God, as <hi>Paul</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it out of <hi>Hoſea, Rom</hi> 9. 26. and it ſhall be in the place, where it was ſaid unto them, <hi>you are not my people,</hi> they ſhall be there called the Sons of the living God. But as to the ſecond and third places, in them we read that the proper and only begotten Son of God was not ſpared, but given and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to death for us, which cannot be ſaid of him that is God by Nature. Yea, from thence that Chriſt is the Son of God, it is apparent that he is not God, otherwiſe he will be the Son of himſelf. Now the reaſon why thoſe attributes are aſcribed to Chriſt, is this, becauſe amongſt all the Sons of God, he is both the chiefeſt, and moſt deare to God, as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe he was moſt dear to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the heir of all things, is called the only begotten, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. although he had a brother <hi>Iſmael.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> is called <hi>the only-begotten in the fight of his Mother, Prov.</hi> 4. 3. although he had more brethren of the ſame mother, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Where is he called the firſt-born of every creature?</p>
               <p>

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:113294:35"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> Neither can it be hence concluded, that Chriſt hath a Divine Nature. For ſince Chriſt is the firſt-born of every creature, it muſt needs be that he alſo is one of the creatures. For ſuch is the force of the word <hi>(firſt-born)</hi> in the Scripture, that it muſt of neceſſity be one of them amongſt whom it is the firſt born; as the firſt-born of ſheep is a ſheep, of aſſes an aſſe, of men a man. But that Chriſt ſhould be the firſt-born of creatures in the Old crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the adverſaries themſelves muſt not admit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will become Arrians. Wherfore they muſt confeſſe that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is one of the New Creation. Whence the Divine Nature of Chriſt is not only not concluded, but it is on the contrary firmly concluded, that he hath no Divine Nature. But that Chriſt is by the Apoſtle called by that name, doth hence proceed, namely that he both in time and dignity precedeth all other things of the New Creation.</p>

Now the ſubject matter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. is that which the Holy Spirit was to declare unto the Apoſtles concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt; and <hi>c.</hi> 17. it is apparent that it is ſpoken of the Diſciples of Chriſt, whom God had given to him, whence he alſo calleth them his own. Beſides, inaſmuch as whatſoever Chriſt hath, he hath it from the grant of the Father, and not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:113294:36"/> from himſelf, it is hence evident, that he hath no ſuch Divine Nature as is imagined. Since he that is a God by Nature hath all things from himſelf.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That a Divine Nature cannot hence be proved, inaſmuch as Chriſt is for a certain reſpect called a Father of eternity, as may be ſeen by the words a little before in the ſame place expreſſed. But it is a wonder that the adverſaries urge this place, eſpecially according to the Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where Chriſt is called the everlaſting Father. For this quite ſubverteth the common Doctrine of the Trinity, by confounding the firſt and ſecond Perſons thereof. But the words may wel be rendred a Father of eternity, or an everlaſting Father, both becauſe he is the Author of eternall life to them that obey him, and liveth for ever to ſhelter and protect and cheriſh Chriſtians, who are elſwhere called his ſeed.

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But where are thoſe Elogies given to Chriſt, namely that he is the word or Speech of God, the Image of the inviſible God, the Character or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe image of his perſon or ſubſtance, that he which ſeeth Chriſt, ſeeth the Father, that in Ieſus Christ dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the Godhead, or of Deity, bodily?</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to theſe pleaſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It cannot from thence be concluded that Chriſt hath a Divine Nature, becauſe he is called the Word of God, yea the contrary is manifeſt.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:113294:36"/> For ſince he is the Word of that one God, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that very one God, unleſſe one wil abſurdly and contradictiouſly ſay he is the Word of himſelf. Which anſwer may be given to every one of theſe teſtimonies. But Jeſus is therefore called the Word, or ſpeech of God, becauſe he hath declared the whole will of God to us, as <hi>John</hi> himſelf ſeemeth to expound it, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is</hi> (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was) <hi>in the boſome of the Father, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him.</hi> As he is in the ſame ſenſe called both Life, and Truth. And the ſame may be ſaid of his being called the Image of the inviſible God. But he is called the expreſſe Image of his perſon or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, hereby is meant, that God hath already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in him, whatſoever he hath promiſed to us. But as to the ſaying of Chriſt, he that ſeeth me, ſeeth the Father, this is not fit to prove the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt; ſince that reaſon of ſeeing is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to the Eſſence of God, which is inviſible, but to the knowledge of thoſe things which Chriſt, as his Fathers Embaſſador, both ſaid and did. For proof of this, ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 45. Neither laſtly can the divine Nature of Chriſt be evinced from thence, namely that all the fulneſſe of the Godhead, or of Deity, dwelleth in him bodily; ſince this word <hi>(God-head)</hi> may denote the divine wil; ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 19. &amp; foraſmuch as the Apoſtle doth oppoſe that ſpeech, not to perſons, but to Philoſophy &amp; legall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, it is evident that it is meant of the Doctrine of Chriſt, not of his Perſon. But ſhould we take the words as they ſound, yet could not ſuch a divine Nature as the adverſaries have imagined, be thence collected. For it is true and manifeſt that the fulnes of Deity or Godhead doth now dwell in Chriſt even bodily, in that his very body is altogether divine, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113294:37"/> being made both of divine &amp; ſpiritual matter, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the heaven, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45, 47, 48. and being indued with divine life, and divine ſplendour, &amp; divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <label>Q.</label> But where ſaith the Scripture that Chriſt had glory with the Father before the world was?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> John 17. 5. Now, Father, glorifie me with thy ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee, before the world was, <hi>or (as the Greek runneth)</hi> with the glory which I had before the world was, with thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to this place?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Neither can the Divine Nature of Chriſt be evinced from hence: for that Chriſt might have glory with the Father before the world was, and yet not be thereupon God, is apparent from 3 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. where the Apoſtle ſaith of the faithfull, <hi>that grace was given to them before the world began.</hi> Beſides it is here written that Chriſt doth beg this glory of the Father, which ſheweth neither that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in actual poſſeſſion therof, for then he would have been in poſſeſſion of it ſtill, and conſequently needed not, as he doth, to beg it as the reward of his work, nor had a Divine Nature, for then his Divine Nature would have ſupplied him with ſuch glory as he wanted, without being beholden to another. Wherefore the ſenſe of the place is, that Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches the Father to grant unto him that glory which he had with him in his decree, before the world began.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Where ſaith the Scripture that the Spirit of Chriſt was in the Prophets?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> 1 Pet. 1. 10. 11. Concerning which ſalvation the Prophets diligently ſcarched and inquired, who propheſied of the grace that ſhould happen to you, ſearching at what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did ſignifie.</p>

               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ſpirit here ſaid to be in the Prophets, is therefore called the ſpirit of Chriſt, either by a prolepſis, becauſe he is now become the ſpirit of Chriſt, or becauſe he foreſignified the things of Chriſt, as Peter himſelfe hinteth, ſaying, when it teſtified beforehand the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the glories that ſhould follow; which forme of ſpeech you likewiſe have, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6. where the ſpirit of truth; and the ſpirit of error, are ſo called, becauſe they ſpeak the things belonging to truth, and to error.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Where ſaith the ſcripture that Chriſt came down from heaven, came out from the father, and came into the world?</p>

                  <label>Q</label> What ſay you to theſe paſſages?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That the divine nature of Chriſt cannot hence be evinced, is apparent, in that the words of the firſt teſtimony, (namely who came down from heaven) may be figuratively taken, as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Every good donation, and every perfect gift is from above, deſcending from the father of light.</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. 10. <hi>I John ſaw the holy City, the new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, deſcending from God out of heaven.</hi> But if they ought properly to be taken, which we moſt willingly admit, it is apparent that they are not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any other, then the ſon of man, who ſince he of neceſſity hath a humane perſon, he cannot be God by nature. Moreover, whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113294:38"/> teſtifieth of Chriſt, that the father ſent him into the world, we read the ſame concerning the Apoſtles of Chriſt, in the words before quoted, <hi>John</hi> 17. 18. <hi>As thou haſt ſent me into the world, ſo have I alſo ſent them into the world.</hi> But that ſaying namely, <hi>that Christ came out from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> are equivalent with his deſcending from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but his coming into the world, is ſuch a thing, which the Scripture ſheweth to have happened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his nativity, ſee <hi>John</hi> 18. 37. where our Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>I was therefore born, and therefore came I into the world, that I ſhould bear Record to the truth,</hi> and 1 John 4. 1. <hi>It is written that many falſe prophets were gone out into the world.</hi> So that from thoſe forms of ſpeech, a divine nature of Chriſt cannot be evinced. But in all theſe ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es is deſcribed how divine the beginning of Chriſts prophetick office was.</p>

                  <hi>But where is Chriſt called that one Lord, Lord of glory, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords?</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> 1 Cor. 8. 6. To us there is one Lord, Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we through him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8.

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to theſe teſtimonies?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As to the firſt, the divine nature of Chriſt cannot be concluded from the Apoſtles calling him that one Lord. For firſt, he manifeſtly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him from the father, whom he confeſſeth to be that one God, whom we formerly ſhewed to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113294:38"/> the onely God by nature. Again, the Apoſtle by ſaying that all things are by him, ſheweth that he is not God by nature. Since, as we formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated this particle [by] doth not deſigne the firſt, but the ſecond cauſe, which cannot be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him that is God by nature. And though the ſcripture ſomtimes ſaith of the Father, <hi>that all things are by him,</hi> yet is this otherwiſe underſtood of him, then of Chriſt: For this is ſpoken of the father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the middle cauſes, whereby ſomething is done, are derived from him, and are not ſuch, as that God cannot work without them, but it is ſaid of Chriſt, that ſome other, namely God, who muſt of neceſſity therefore be the firſt cauſe, doth work all things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9. It is expreſly ſaid. I need not commemorate that the word [all] is here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto the ſubject matter, as the very arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſet before it in the Greek ſufficienly ſheweth, Much more theſe two words [us] and [Father] which plainly demonſtrate that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the things that pertain to Chriſtians, whence it followeth that Chriſt is not called that one Lord ſimply, and abſolutely, but for a certain reſpect, as being he, by whom all the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Chriſtians are adminiſtred. As for the ſecond teſtimony, ſince it is there treated of him that was crucified, it is clear that the divine nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thence be concluded, ſince no ſuch thing can be affirmed of the divine nature, but only of a man, who is therefore called the Lord of glory, that is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hebrew Phraſe the glorious Lord, becauſe he was by God crowned with glory and honour. In the third teſtimony ſince it is ſpoken of him who is a lamb, &amp; clothed with garments, whom the ſame <hi>John</hi> moſt openly teſtifieth to have been ſlain, and to have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113294:39"/> redeemed us with his blood, (which thing can by no means be referred to the divine nature) it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the divine nature of Chriſt cannot thence be aſſerted, but all the things that are in theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies aſcribed to Chriſt argue his ſingular autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to him by God, in relation to the things of the new covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Queſtion,</label> What teſtimonies of Scripture may be alleadged for believing in Chriſt, and giving divine honour to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer, John</hi> 14. 1. Chriſt himſelf ſaith, Yee believe in God, believe alſo in me. And <hi>John</hi> 3. verſes 14, 15. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth on him may not periſh, but have eternall life. And <hi>John</hi> 5. verſ. 22. 23. The Father judgeth no man, but hath given all the judgement to the ſon, that all ſhould honour the ſon, as they honour the Father, and <hi>Philippians</hi> 2. verſ. 9, 10, 11. wherefore God hath exceedingly exalted, and given him a name above every name, that in the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of heavenly, earthly, and infernall things; and every tongue ſhould confeſſe that Jeſus is Lord to the glory of God the Father, and in ſundry other places.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Question,</label> What ſay you to theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer,</label> As to the firſt, it is ſo far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Chriſt is God by nature, that it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth him to be a far different one. For it openly putteth a difference between Chriſt, and that one God, of whom that is here treated, the Article added in the Greek doth intimate. Now whereas the adverſaries ſay, that faith is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:113294:39"/> not to be placed, but in God himſelf, this ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Chriſt in another place, whileſt he ſaith, he that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me. whence it is evident, that Chriſt arrogateth not that faith to himſelf, which we ow to God onely; for that faith is, due to God onely, which is terminated in him, and which hath reſpect to him as the prime author of all things, but it is clear that ſuch faith is not attributed to Chriſt, for we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believe on Chriſt, becauſe he hath obtained of God a power to make us eternally happy, and is appointed unto that office; whereby it cometh to paſſe, that our faith on Chriſt, is through him directed to God himſelf, as the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end, which is atteſted by <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, through him (Chriſt) you believe in God, that raiſed him up from the dead, and gave him glory, ſo that your faith and hope is on God, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Question,</label> But they alledge out of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> that he is curſed who truſteth in man, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>An.</label> It is not ſaid abſolutely, that he is curſed who truſteth in man, but he, who ſo truſteth in him, as that he maketh fleſh his arm, that is, faſteneth his whole hope in meer humane forces, without the aſſiſtance of divine power; for that is, underſtood by the word fleſh, to which theſe words are further added, [and his heart departeth from the Lord. But we who place our confidence on Chriſt, do not make fleſh our arm, nor in our heart depart from God, yea in truſting on Chriſt, we truſt on God himſelf, and ſo our heart cometh unto God, and not departeth from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you to the other teſtimonies which ſpeak of Chriſts divine honour.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:113294:40"/>
               <p> Foraſmuch as all the places that teſtifie concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts divine honour, do alſo teſtifie that this honour was given to him at a certain time, and for a certain cauſe, it is plain that the divine nature of Chriſt cannot thence be collected. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the adverſaries object that of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 42. 8. <hi>I will not give me glory to another.</hi> I anſwer that it is apparent enough what he meaneth by another, for he preſently addeth, <hi>nor my praiſe to graven i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</hi> In this place therefore God ſpeaketh of them who have no communion with him, and to whom if any glory and honour be aſcribed, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth not to him. But he ſaith not, that he will not communicate his glory with ſuch an one as is dependent, of him &amp; ſubordinate to him, for by this means no diminution of his glory is made, ſince the whole is referred to him, for ſince the Lord Jeſus dependeth of him, and is ſubordinate to him, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever honour is given to Jeſus, redoundeth wholly to God himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> I have been in informed touching thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which ſeem directly to reſpect the ſon of God, I would fain learn thoſe alſo which are applyed to Chriſt by a certain accommodation, and ſeem to prove a Divine nature in Chriſt.</p>

                  <label>An.</label> Yes, wherereof ſome contain to outward Rights, commonly called ceremonies, others to judge men, but Chriſt took them away, either expreſly or tacitly, expreſly by the Apoſtles, but eſpecially by <hi>Paul</hi> who aboliſhed a great part of Precepts belonging to outward rights, or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which were not openly taken away, are to be thought aboliſhed by the propriety of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for the ſame cauſe that the others were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, which we find to be expreſly abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>

                  <label>Anſwer,</label> This, that it is altogether ſpirituall, and not placed in any outward things, but inward
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:113294:43"/> ones, but externall rights commonly called cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, are not ſpirituall, in that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the outward features, wherefore unleſſe there be one expreſſe commandement touching ſuch a thing in the new covenant, we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that under the new Covenant it is not to be obſerved, ſo that it is to be held, that whatſoever pertaining to Ceremonies, was commanded under the old covenant, doth not all belong to the New.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer,</label> Yes, in <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. 17. <hi>Let none judge you in meats or drinks, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of an holy day, or new moons, or ſaboths, which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is of Chriſt:</hi> and hence it cometh to paſſe, that all other ceremonies, though they be not openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, are yet to be thought tacitly abrogated, ſince it is evident that they were all ſhadows of thoſe things, that have appeared in the new covenant, although certain ceremonies of the old covenant were ſuch, as that they were on this ground abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, becauſe they pertained onely to the old and not to the new.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What are ſuch ceremonies?</p>

Beſides, that law forbiddeth us to have other Gods, before the Lord God, and Chriſt is not an other God; but in that very worſhip which is given to him ſubordinate to that one God, it is apparent that that law is no way changed, ſince it is well known that ſubordinate things are not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to one another.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> No, for in the worſhip of God, it is not enough to ground our ſelves upon opinion, though never ſo ſpecious, but thereunto there is need of the very truth it ſelf, otherwiſe that worſhip ought juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be accounted for Idolatry.</p>

                  <hi>I perceive that none but God and Chriſt is to be worſhipped, but may we not invocate the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and the Saints, not that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may beſtow any thing upon us, but impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate it by their prayers unto God and Chriſt?</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You may perceive, by the definition of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we have given, that to abſtain from a certain ſort of meats is not faſting, but rather a choiſe of meats, which the Apoſtle reproveth, and reckoneth amongſt the doctrines of Devils, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> Ought thoſe that fast to be tyed unto certain dayes?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> At no hand, for the ſame is contrary both to the property and liberty of the Chriſtian Religion, which is ſpirituall, and not at all tyed to times. Neither is faſting acceptable to God, unleſſe the glory of God, and the Salvation of our ſelves, or others, or ſome preſſing neceſſities draw it from us. Wherefore the whole time alotted unto faſting, is to be ſpent upon Chriſtian exerciſes, as reading, and explaining the Word of God, ardent Prayers, and pious Conferences.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>WHat are Chriſts Ceremoniall Precepts, as they call them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> There is but one, namely the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is an Inſtitution of the Lord, that the Faithfull ſhould break, and eat the Bread, and drink of the Cup, to declare the death of the Lord; which Inſtitution is to continue till the Lords coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is it to declare the Lords death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is in a ſolemn and publick manner to give thanks, that he, out of his unſpeakable love, would ſuffer his body to be tortured, and in a manner bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his Bloud to be ſhed for us, and ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll and celebrate this great benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhy would the Lord have the memory of this thing above all others, to be celebrated in his Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Becauſe of all the actions of Chriſt it is the chiefeſt, and moſt proper to him; for though the Reſurrection and Exaltation of Chriſt be far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet they were performed by God the Father, and not by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Is there not another reaſon, for which the Lord inſtituted the Supper?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> None at all, although men have deviſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſome ſaying that it is a ſacrifice for the quick and dead; others, that by the uſe thereof, they gain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:113294:57"/> of their Sins, and hope to confirm their Faith, and bring to their remembrance the Lords death.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat are we to hold concerning theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That none of them can ſtand; for ſince that is the end of celebrating the Lords Supper, that we ſhould give thanks to Chriſt for benefits received, it is apparent that it was not therefore inſtituted, that we ſhould there receive ſomething, yea he that will worthily partake of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he ought to be aſſured of the remiſſion of ſins on the part of God, and confirmed in the faith, and ſo affected, that the death of Chriſt never ſlip out of his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat are we to think of that opinion which ſaith, that the Supper is a ſacrifice for the quick and dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That it is a moſt grievous error; for the Scripture teſtifieth that the offering of Chriſt was performed in heaven, and could not be performed on the earth. Beſides, ſince Chriſt himſelf is both Prieſt and ſacrifice, it followeth that none can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelf. Finally, ſince the Sacrifice of of Chriſt is altogether perfect, ſince it is one, whereby he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified, there is no need that it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, otherwiſe it would not be perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1. 2, 3. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is the meaning of thoſe words, this is my body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are not taken by all in one and the ſame manner, for ſome think that the bread is truly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the body of Chriſt, and the wine into
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113294:58"/> his blood, which turning, they call Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, others think that the Lords body is with, in, and under the bread. Finally there are ſome, who in the Lords Supper think they are truly parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Body and Blood of the Lord, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. All which Opinions are fallacious and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How will you demonſtrate that?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Becauſe in theſe words [This is my Body] the particle [This] may be referred to the whole action of breaking, and taking the Bread, and pouring out the Wine. Wherefore it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily referred to the Bread and Wine only by the Adverſaries; neither can their captious opinions be hence framed, and contrived. Beſides, as to the Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf, (as they call it) ſince the Scripture doth in the very uſe give the name of Bread, to that Berad we take, as appeareth from the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. and chap. 11. 26, 27, 28. It is evident, that Bread remaineth there without any tranſmutation into the Lords Body. Furthermore, the ſame Scripture teſtifieth, that the Body of Chriſt is in the Heavens, and muſt be there contained till the times of the reſtitution of all things: wherefore it cannot any more exiſt on the Earth. In a word, if the Bread were turned into the very Body of Chriſt, it would follow, that the immortall Body of Chriſt (wherewith all agree, that he is now endued) is taken in a groſſe and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall manner: but this cannot be, that an immortall Body ſhould be ſo taken, and conſequently neither can the Bread be turned into Chriſts Body. As to the ſecond Opinion, that, as it cannot conſiſt for the former reaſons, eſpecially this, that the Body of Chriſt is now in the Heavens; ſo neither can it for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113294:58"/> his grand inconvenience, namely, that this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth deveſt the Body of Chriſt of its properties. Laſtly, as to the third Opinion, that cannot have place, ſince it is abſutd, that one ſhould be really partaker of Chriſts body, and alſo ſpiritually. And they themſelves ſufficiently bewray the uncertainty of their own opinion, whilſt they confeſſe that this manner of receiving the Body of Chriſt is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inexplicable, or at leaſt that they are utterly ignorant how it is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>VVhat is to be held touching the uſe of the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt?</hi> John 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Chriſt doth not in that place treat of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for there he doth without any condition aſcribe Eternall Life to him that ſhall eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood; and on the contrary taketh Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life away from him that ſhall not eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood. Which, that it is not ſpoken of the Lords Supper, is evident from hence, in that a man may partake of the Lords Supper, and yet periſh. And on the contrary may be ſaved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he partake not thereof. But Chriſt there ſpeaketh concerning the cauſe of Faith on him, which is the continuall meditation of the death of Chriſt, from whence we derive ſtrength unto a pious, and immortall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>How are thoſe words of</hi> Paul <hi>to be taken; The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Bloud of Chriſt? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In ſuch a manner, as that all thoſe who bleſſe this Cup, that is, uſing it, celebrate the name of the Lord, and bleſſe him; and alſo thoſe that break the Bread in Communion, do thereby openly teſtifie,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:113294:59"/> that they are partakers of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, that is, of all thoſe things which Chriſt by his death hath procured to us. As he a little after ſpeaketh of the Iſraelites, ſaying, that the Iſraelites, who did eat the Sacrifice, were partakers of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, that is, belonged unto all thoſe things, which were promiſed in that Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Explicate therefore to me the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of thoſe words, This is my Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is, as if Chriſt had ſaid, this action of breaking and eating this bread, is a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and certain adumbration of that which is to be done with my Body; and this action pouring out, and drinking this Wine, is a commemoration, and repreſentation of what is to be done with my Bloud; or (that we may explain the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25.) the drinking of this Cup is a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that exceſſive love of God exhibited to us in the New Covenant, and confirmed by the death of Chriſt. In this manner it is written concerning the ſolemn cuſtome of eating the Paſchal Lamb, (for they had their loynes girded, their feet ſhod, their ſtaves in their hands, and did eat it haſtily) that it was the Paſſeover of the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11, 27. Thus alſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. it is ſaid of the ſhorn hairs, part whereof was burned, part ſcattered, part conſerved: that this was <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That it is an externall Rite, whereby men coming from Judaiſme, or Gentiliſme to the Chriſtian Religion, did profeſſe openly, that they acknowledge Chriſt for their Lord.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means, for neither have we in the Scripture either precept, or example thereof; nor can they, as the thing it ſelf ſheweth, acknowledge Chriſt for their Lord.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Although they erre herein, yet is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lawfull to condemn them, ſo that they be not otherwiſe Idolaters, but live piouſly according to Commandments of Jeſus Chriſt, and forbear to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute others, who reject their opinion. For the Kingdom of God conſiſteth not in theſe outward things, but in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Spirit.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> They are exceedingly miſtaken, for Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is nothing but the transformation of our mind, and will, and compoſure of them to the doctrine of our Saviour Chriſt, as the very word
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:113294:60"/>
[Regeneration] doth intimate. But ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation cannot have place in Infants, who know not good and evill, much leſſe that a thing of ſo great moment ſhould be incident to them. But that thoſe of perfect age, in whom the transformation of mind and will hath place, ſhould be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Water, is ſo diſtant from truth, that it ſeemeth to carry a face of Idolatry with it, whilſt that is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to a groſſe elementall thing, which is onely to be aſcribed to God himſelf, and his Word, ſince it is he, who hath of his own will begotten us by the Word of his truth; and that incorruptible ſeed, whereof we muſt be regenerated, is the Word of God that liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>But the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. <hi>that God hath ſaved us by the Laver of Regeneration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> True, but he doth not therefore affirm, that that Laver of Regeneration is the Babtiſm of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neither is it unuſuall in the Scriptures, that the purlfication of our Souls, which is wrought by the Word, ſhould be ſiguratively called a Laver; for the ſame, <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. writeth, That Chriſt hath ſanctified his Church, having purified her with the Laver of water in the Word. And the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> exhorteth them, who had long ſince given their names to Chriſt, and did no more ſtand in need of the Baptiſme of water, that they ſhould have their hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and their body waſhed with pure water. Finally, the Apoſtle himſelf in this very place, which we have in hand, explaineth himſelf, what he meaneth by the Laver of Regeneration, ſub-joyning thoſe words that give light to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ones, namely, [And renewing of the holy Spirit.] For that this particle [and] is ſometimes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:113294:60"/> all one with, [that is] was formerly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>But as concerning theſe words of</hi> Ananias <hi>to</hi> Paul, <hi>ariſe, be baptiſed and waſh away thyſins, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving invocated the name of the Lord,</hi> Acts 22. 16. <hi>what is to be held?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is to be held, and we ſhall find this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation give light to many other places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when in the writings of the new covenant, that is aſcribed to ſome act or outward ceremony, which altogether belongeth to eternall ſalvation, this is not therefore done, as if that act or outward ceremony had ſuch power, but becauſe thereby a certain adumbration is made of that thing, which altogether belongeth to ſalvation. Thus when it is ſaid, The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the Blood of Chriſt? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and elſewhere, as many of you, as have been baptiſed into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. And after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the words of <hi>Ananias</hi> may and ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; although the place may be ſo conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that the meaning of <hi>Ananias</hi> was not that <hi>Paul</hi> by the Baptiſme of water ſhould waſh away his ſins, but that he ſhould be baptiſed, and waſh away his ſins, by invocating the name of the Lord, ſince the time was now come, wherein every one that called upon the name of the Lord ſhould be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Doth not our Saviour Chriſt in his conference with</hi> Nichodemus John 3. 5. <hi>by water understand Baptiſme?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means, for there he ſpeaketh of being born from above, but the water of Baptiſme co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113294:61"/> not from above, beſides he treateth of ſuch a regeneration, without which none can enter into heaven, which reaſon it ſelf ſheweth, cannot be ſaid of the Baptiſme of water. Now that water and the ſpirit are the ſame in that place, ſo that by water is meant the ſpirit, or ſpirituall water, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thence to be plain, in that the particle [and] may in this place ſignifie [that is] as we formerly ſhewed, that it ſometimes ſignifieth ſo in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by name in that paſſage, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 11. which is like to this under conteſtation, and where <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> ſaith, He ſhall baptiſe you with the Holy Spirit and Fire. Hence it is, that Chriſt in the progreſſe of his diſcourſe with <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> maketh no more mention of water, but onely of the Holy Spirit.</p>

                  <label>A.</label> Nothing hinders but that you may hope for ſomething, although you have not the Promiſe of God for the ſame, ſo that the thing be very deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſuch, as it is very likely, that God will give unto thoſe that ſerve him. But neither is any thing more deſirable then Eternall Life, nor more credible, then that God will beſtow it upon them that ſerve him as the reward, that is ſuitable to his perſon, without which, the other things, though
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:113294:62"/> proceeding from God, are ſcarce worthy to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Divine reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> And why ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> For two reaſons, firſt, becauſe not ſo much the good it ſelf, as the perpetuity thereof, ſeemeth to have ſome Divinity in it. Next, becauſe it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that of other good things, except Eternall Life; even thoſe, and thoſe chiefly are partakers, who regard not the ſervice of God, yea, blaſpheme him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Shall they have Eternall Life, who hoped for the ſame, all bough it was not promiſed to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, but not all, but thoſe onely that ſerved God with their whole heart, and were obedient to him. For nothing hinders, but that God may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme more then he promiſed. And Chriſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth this, when from the words of God he truly and ſubtilly collecteth, that <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall ariſe from the dead, and live, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 37, 38. whom the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> imitating, chap. 11. 16. ſaith, That God is not aſhamed of them, to be called their God, for that he hath provided a city for them, and hath decreed that they ſhall live for ever with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> If God will give Eternall Life to thoſe men, why did he not promiſe it?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> God deferred ſo excellent a Promiſe till a fit time, that it might the more evidently appear to all, that ſo excellent a thing is his proper Gift, flowing from his meer bounty.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Are there not in the New Covenant, beſides Eternall Life, Promiſes likewiſe made concerning this Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Scripture teſtifieth, that Picty, even under the New Covenant, hath the promiſe of this
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113294:62"/> life, as well as of the life to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And likewiſe if any man, for the ſake of Chriſt, and of the Goſpell, ſhall forſake all things, that he ſhall receive a hundred fold even in this life, with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and in the world to come, life everlaſting, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 29, 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Is the New Covenant, then equall to the Old, as to the promiſes of this preſent life?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Since it appeareth from other places of the Scripture, that a Chriſtian ought to reſt in thoſe things that are neceſſary to the maintenance of his life, it appeareth that the Promiſes of this life made under the New Covenant, though in themſelves very full and plenteous, ought ſo to be taken, as that a Chriſtian ſhall not want any thing that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required to the maintenance of this life. But under the Old Covenant it was lawfull, not only to get, and poſſeſſe more then the neceſſity of this life did require, but alſo ſuperfluities, pleaſures, and other things, without which we may be in this life, ſo that this was done without injury to another. Wherefore the promiſes of this life under the Old Covenant, are not to be reſtrained, but to be taken as the words ſound. Whence likewiſe it may be ſeen, that Eternall Life was not promiſed under the Old Covenant, otherwiſe the New would not have better Promiſes then the Old, contrary to what the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> affirmeth, chap. 8. 6.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> DEclare to me the other Promiſe, and explain what the Gift of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Gift of the holy Spirit promiſed in the New Covenant, is two-fold, the one perpetuall, the other temporary, which was viſible, as the firſt inviſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat was that temporary and viſible Gift?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The gift of doing Miracles, which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was openly given to thoſe that believed on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhy did not that Gift alwayes continue?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Becauſe it was granted to confirme the New Covenant, which, when it ſeemed to God to be ſufficiently confirmed, that Gift by his pleaſure and counſell ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVhat mean you by theſe words, namely, That the New Covenant was ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> I mean, that thoſe, who were apt to believe the Goſpell, had ſufficient ground for their Faith (from what had been done for the confirmation of the Covenant) to all ſuceeding times.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> But who are thoſe that are apt to believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Such are endued with honeſty of heart, or are at leaſt, not averſe therefrom. For it is not in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113294:63"/> will of God, that thoſe who are otherwiſe qualified, ſhould have no cauſe to reject the Goſpel; which would have come to paſſe, had that confirmation been perpetuall. For there would have been no man found ſo wicked, who would not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the doctrine of Chriſt for true, and have embraced it, not ſo much out of a love to piety, and virtue, as out of a deſire of that ſoverain good, which Chriſt hath promiſed to his followers, namely, Eternall Life. Whereby it would have come to paſſe, that in the Chriſtian Religion, which by the will and counſell of God is to diſtinguiſh the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt from the diſhoneſt, there would have been no difference between good and bad.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Before I unfold this, I muſt demonſtrate, that under the New Covenant, there is a certain Gift of the holy Spirit, which continueth for ever in the Church of Chriſt.</p>

                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Yea, I deſire you to doe ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Beſides other teſtimonies, it is evident from thoſe words of our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. that God doth, and alwayes will give his holy Spirit to his Children, that begge the ſame of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What is the holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That you may the better underſtand what the holy Spirit is, conſider with your ſelf, Firſt, that in the Scripture of the New Covenant, by the word [Spirit] is ſometimes deſigned the very Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, partly, becauſe the things contained therein, are ſuch as were revealed by God himſelf, and could not have been diſcovered by the wit of man; partly, becauſe it reſpecteth the ſpirit of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:113294:64"/> man, and maketh us ſpirituall, which the Law could not do. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. But now we are freed from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held,: ſo that we ſerve in newneſſe of the Spirit, and not in oldneſſe of the Letter. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath freed me from the Law of Sin, and Death. And <hi>ver.</hi> 9. If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. the ſame Apoſtle calleth himſelf, not a Miniſter of the Letter, that is, the Law, but of the Spirit, or New Covenant. Secondly, by the word Spirit, is underſtood ſuch a Gift of God, as is by the Scripture called an Earneſt, or pledge of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. chap. 5. 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14. So that we thereby conceive a firm and certain hope of the Eternall life that is promiſed to us, have a kind of taſte and feeling thereof in our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Do we not perceive a hope of Eternall Life by the very preaching of the Goſpell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, in ſome meaſure; for from the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell, a hope of Eternall life therein promiſed, may be acquired, otherwiſe why ſhould that Life be there promiſed: But to faſten, and rivet in our minds a firm and certain hope thereof, by vertue whereof we may continue invincible in all temptations, it ſeemeth requiſite that that promiſe outwardly propoſed by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, ſhould be inwardly ſealed in our hearts by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Queſt.</label> 
                  <hi>Doth this inward ſealing happen unto all, to whom the outward preaching of the Goſpell cometh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> At no hand, but onely unto them who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:113294:64"/> believe the Goſpell preached to them, and ſo right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe that outward means imployed by God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the promiſe of Eternall Life. For if that Gift of the holy Spirit, which continued but for a time, was given only to thoſe that believed the Goſpell, much more are we to hold, that that Gift of the holy Spirit, which is perpetuall, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to others; but them who have ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Goſpell, and from their hearts embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Is there not need of the inward Gift of the holy Spirit to believe the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> By no means; for neither do we read in the holy Scriptures, that that Gift is conferred on any one, but him that believeth the Goſpel. See <hi>John</hi> 7. 38, 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 21, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 7, 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Since you have declared to me what the Gift of the holy Spirit is, I deſire you alſo to declare whether the holy Spirit be a perſon of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That the holy Spirit is not a perſon of the God-head, is evident from the Scriptures, wherein it is affirmed that he is given, and ſent by God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 21. 22. 23, 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. yea, in the name of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. That he ſpeaketh not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but what he heareth, glorifying Chriſt in that he receiveth of his, and declareth it to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. 14. that he is the Advocate, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17. compared with 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. where you have the ſame Greek appellation in both place, but in the latter the Engliſh Tranſlators themſelves ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it [Advocate]. That he maketh interceſſion for the Saints with groans inutterable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26: All which, with ſundry other things, that might
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:113294:65"/> be enumerated, cannot poſſibly agree to him that is a perſon of the God-head, and conſequently the moſt High God.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Innocency of his Life was ſuch, that he

                  <hi>But what reaſon was there that the Saviour ſhould endure the ſame afflictions and death with the ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> There are two reaſons thereof, as Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaveth the Faithfull in a two-fold way; for firſt, by his example, he moveth them to perſiſt in the way of Salvation that they have entred into. Next,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113294:66"/> he ſtandeth by them in every combate of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, afflictions, and troubles, and at length delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them from Eternall Death. But how could Chriſt by his own example have moved the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to perſiſt in that ſingular Piety and innocency, without which they cannot be ſayed, had he not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of a bitter death, which is eaſily wont to attend true Piety? Or how could he have had a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling of the calamities and ſufferings of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſo become the more ready to help them, unleſſe himſelf had tryed how grievous, and of themſelves intolerable to humane nature they are? firſt of theſe is hinted by <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. 21. Chriſt ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps. The latter, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 2. 18. Chriſt, in that he ſuffered, being tempted, is able to ſuccour them that are tempted: And chap. 4. 15. He can have a fellow-feeling of our infirmities, having been tempted in all things after the ſame manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> He could indeed, if he would change the nature and condition of things. But God is not wont to do this, unleſſe ſometimes, and that very ſeldome, and in ſome ſpeciall caſes, and for a time, but not alwayes, and commonly, as it would here be very behoovefull, had he a mind to exempt the Faithfull from afflictions, and violent deaths.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:113294:67"/> any one. The firſt whereof naturally expoſeth them to the hatred of all wicked men, which make the greateſt part of mankinde, whereby it cometh to paſſe, that they grievouſly afflict the Faithfull, and if an occaſion be offered, inflict death upon them. The latter is a greater incitement to the wicked, and affordeth them an opportunity to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and accompliſh their cruell deſignes upon the Faithfull.</p>

And the Bloud of ſprinkling, (that is, of federation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 19, 20.) which ſpeaketh better things then that of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 12. 24, 25. And Chriſt himſelf is called the true and faithfull Witneſſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. and chap. 3. 14.

For that mercy is not ſo in God by Nature, as they imagine, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe he could not then puniſh any ſin at all: and on the contrary were that Juſtice in God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

For inſtance, ſince wiſdome is in God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God never doth any thing contrary thereunto; but whatſoever he doth, he doth it wiſely.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that Juſtice, whereby God puniſheth ſins, and which the Adverſaries oppoſe to Mercy, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <label>Anſw.</label> That Chriſt took away from us, both our ſins, and the puniſhment of them, as perfectly as if he had born them on his own Body, or carryed them away into a far Country; as the Scripture elſewhere ſaith, that he is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. and that he was once offered, that he might bear, or take away ſins of many, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 21.</p>

                  <hi>What is Faith on our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> This Faith is in the Scripture ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a double conſideration, ſometimes it noteth that Faith, which is not neceſſarily attended with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes that which is ſo attended.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>What is that Faith which is not neceſſarily attended with Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is a bare aſſent to the Doctrine of Chriſt as true, which, that it is not of neceſſity attended with Salvation, appeareth from the example of thoſe Rulers, <hi>John</hi> 12. 42. Of whom the Evangeliſt ſaith, that many of them believed on Chriſt, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Phariſees durſt not to confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogues.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>What is that Faith which is of neceſſity atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is a confidence through Chriſt on God; whence it appeareth that that Faith on Chriſt comprehendeth two things; firſt, that we confide not only on God, but alſo on Chriſt; next, that we be obedient unto God, not in thoſe things only, which he hath commanded in the Law delivered by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113294:73"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes,</hi> and are not abrogated by Chriſt; but alſo in thoſe things which Chriſt hath added to the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Doe you then comprehend obedience under Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, for the thing it ſelf ſheweth, that none can be found, who conceiveth in his mind a certain hope of Eternall Life, which Chriſt hath promiſed onely to thoſe that obey him, who is not alſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Chriſt, in as much as Eternall Life is ſuch a good, as no man can wittingly and willingly deſpiſe it. Beſides, <hi>James</hi> openly teſtifieth, that as the Body without the Spirit is dead, ſo Faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo without Works is dead, <hi>James</hi> 2. 26. and a little above he had ſaid, that the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was perfected by Works, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. For which reaſon likewiſe pious men, and ſuch as are obedient to God, are called the Faithfull.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In thoſe places where he oppoſeth Faith to Works, he ſpeaketh of ſuch works, as contain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and perpetuall obedience, which was by God required under the Law: but not of ſuch works as comprehend that obedience which God requireth of us, who believe on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That putting off the Old man with his Works, we deſiſt from all our former ſins, which thing the Scripture calleth Repentance. Next, that according to our ability, we perform the Will of God, ſo as that we walk not after the Fleſh, but by the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the fleſh. In ſhort, that we contract the habit of no ſin, but gain to our ſelves the habits of all Chriſtian Vertues.</p>

                  <hi>DOth it lie in our power to obey God in that manner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Yes, for it is certain, that the firſt Man was ſo created by God, as that he was endued with Free-will. Neither was there any cauſe why God, after his fall, ſhould deprive him thereof. And indeed the Juſtice of God doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, nor is there any mention of ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, amongſt thoſe puniſhments that God inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Adam</hi> for his tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label>
                  <hi>Is not this Free-wil depraved by Originall ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> There is no ſuch thing as Originall ſinne, wherefore neither can it deprave Free-will. For, that Originall ſinne cannot be proved out of the Scripture. And the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> being but one act, could not have ſuch power as to deprave his own nature, much leſſe the nature of all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But that this puniſhment was inflicted upon <hi>Adam,</hi> neither doth the Scripture any where relate, and it is altogether unſuitable to God, who is the fountain of all equity, ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>But yet that there is Originall ſin, ſeemeth to be proved by that teſtimony,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. <hi>All the thoughts of mans heart were only evill, and that continually; and</hi> Gen. 8. 21. <hi>The thought of mans heart is evill from his child-hood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Theſe teſtimonies ſpeak of voluntary ſin, ſo quireth of them; But a will to perform them is in all men by nature: yet is not that ability ſo little, that, if a man will offer violence to himſelf, he may not by the acceſſion of the Divine Aſſiſtance, obey the Divine Will. But God denieth his aſſiſtance to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:113294:74"/> that Originall ſin cannot be proved thence. For as for the firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth that it was ſuch a ſin, for which it repented God that he had made Man, and he reſolved to puniſh him with a Flood; which certainly can by no means be affirmed of ſin that is in man by nature, ſuch as they think Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin to be. But in the other teſtimony he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the ſin of man ſhall not have ſuch power, that God for it ſhould puniſh the World with a Flood. which alſo doth not agree with originall ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>What think you of</hi> David, <hi>who ſaith,</hi> Pſal. 51. 7. <hi>that he was conceived in ſin, and by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhaped in iniquity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is to be noted, that <hi>David</hi> doth not here ſpeak of all men, but only of himſelf; nor that ſimply, but in reſpect of his fall; uſing ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as you have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 4.

For all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and diligence, is there ſuperfluous, where all things come to paſſe neceſſarily, as reaſon it ſelf ſheweth.

For if the opinion of the Adverſaries be true, they, by reaſon of the immutable decree of God cannot poſſibly become pious and obedient. 2. Hypocriſie, joyned with deceit: For God having excluded already the greateſt part of them, to whom the Goſpel is declared, from ſalvation, by his decree, doth notwithſtanding offer ſalvation unto all; and ſo doth one thing, and maketh ſhew of another, which is the property of Hypocrites and deceivers; And which is worſe, God doth in ſuch a thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:113294:76"/> another is exceedingly circumvented and hurt. 3. Great imprudence; for God would ſeem to take care, and endeavour that, which he certainly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cannot come to paſſe. But what is more fooliſh and light, then to make a ſhew as if you earneſtly endeavoured to effect that, which you know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be done, and ſo to expoſe your ſelf to ſcorn. 4. Pravity, in that God would be the author of ſin. For ſince it is altogether neceſſary that ſin ſhould go before damnation, certainly he that decrees a man ſhall be of neceſſity damned, decrees alſo that he ſhal of neceſſity ſin.</p>

Which that it is ſo, appeareth from the very poſition of the Apoſtle, which is ſuch: Not all, who are born of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, are truly his ſons, and ſuch as to whom the promiſes of Eternall Happineſſe, made to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> doe belong, but only thoſe, whom God vouchſafeth that Grace, without any regard had to their birth according to the fleſh, of which ſort are they that have believed in God through Chriſt, (of what parents ſoever they are deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and by this means are become the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the Spirit. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that righteouſneſſe and ſalvation are not to be fetched from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delivered to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> according to the fleſh; but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, which hath ſince been propoſed for ever by the ſame God to the Spirituall ſons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And this is the genuine meaning of the place. Wherefore, as we willingly conſent
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:113294:78"/> that there is no man, who by his willing, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, could, or can obtain to move God to conferre ſome benefit upon him: ſo in like manner, after God hath offered Grace, that a man either cannot accept and embrace the Grace offered, or guide his life according to the preſcript of the Divine Will, we account a pernicious Errour.</p>

Now that this manner of drawing is not made by force, or violence, firſt appeareth from what our Saviour ſub-joyneth in the ſame place, where he explaineth that way of drawing, ſaying, They ſhall be all taught of God. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath heard from the Father, and learned, he commeth unto me, <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. where it is clear, that to be drawn by the Father, is no other then to hear from the Father, and to be taught. And how that is done, appeareth from the words of Chriſt a little after expreſſed, Not that any man hath ſeen the Father, but he that was from God, he hath ſeen the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 46. Again, it is perſpicuous, that that way of drawing, pertaineth unto all, to whom the declaration of the Goſpell doth come, as may be eaſily collected from that place, where Jeſus ſaith, When I am lifted up from the Earth, I will draw all men unto me, <hi>John</hi> 12. 32.</p>

            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> They are exceedingly miſtaken, ſince the Scripture ſaith manifeſtly in infinite places, that God, the Father of Chriſt, raiſed him from the dead. Which is ſo true, that the writings of the New Covenant, in many places not expreſſing the Name of God, doe thus deſcribe him, He that raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 24. chap. 8. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> How cometh it to paſſe that they hold ſuch an opinion?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> They think it is hinted in ſome paſſages of the Scripture, as when Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. ſaith, Deſtroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it up. And afterwards, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17, 18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father loveth me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I may take it again. None taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:113294:81"/> lay it down, and power to take it again. And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3. 18. Chriſt once ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortified in the Fleſh, but quickned in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> What anſwer you to the firſt?</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, I anſwer, that ſo few, obſcure, and figurative places, ought not to be oppoſed to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and perſpicuous ones, ſo that a few obſcure pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould explain many perſpicuous ones: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the few and obſcure places ſhould be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the tenour of the many and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous ones. Again, as to the firſt teſtimony, the ſenſe may be, that Chriſt being brought again from the dead, ſhould raiſe up or erect his Body, namely, when God had put life again into it. But indeed, in ſuch figurative expreſſions, not ſo much the words in particular, as the ſenſe is to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eſpecially if the obvious and literall ſenſe ſeem to contain in it ſomewhat that is falſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to other places of the Scripture. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe if any man will obſtinately urge that expreſſion, [I will raiſe it up] let him conſider, firſt, that the Scripture is wont to ſay a man doth a thing, which he onely cauſeth to be done, or is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof; thus <hi>Jeremy,</hi> chap. 38. 23. ſaith to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Thou ſhalt be taken by the hand of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thou ſhalt burn this City with fire, (for ſo the Hebrew context hath it) And <hi>John</hi> 12. 25. He that hateth his life, (or rather ſoul) in this world, ſhall keep it unto Eternall life. Yet neither did <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> if you ſpeak properly, burn the City, nor doe thoſe that ſuffer death for the Word of God, properly keep their Soul. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in as much as the Jewes demand of Chriſt,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:113294:81"/> that he ſhould doe a Signe, it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſo ſhape his anſwer, as if he himſelf were to doe the thing he ſpeaketh of, otherwiſe he had not ſo oppoſitely anſwered them, yet that his words might carry a ſufficient intimation, that he himſelf ſhould not properly do the work, it is obſervable, that in the Greek he omits the particle [I] ſaying onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which had it been inſerted, would have clearly ſhewn that he had truly raiſed himſelf, though even then it could not have been thence firmly collected, that he did it by his own power, and conſequently was the moſt High God.</p>

I have alſo power (or right, or priviledge, as the Greek will bear) to take it, (or receive it, as the Greek may alſo be rendred) becauſe the Father hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:113294:82"/> that if I lay down my life, and ſuffer death, he will raiſe me again from the dead.</p>

The Prieſtly Office of Chriſt therefore, conſiſteth herein, that as by his Kingly Office, he is able to aſſiſt us in all our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, ſo by his Prieſtly Office he is willing to doe ſo, and conſequently aſſiſteth us.

            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> How doth Jeſus accompliſh in Heaven the expiation of our ſins?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> Firſt, he delivereth from the puniſhments of them, whilſt by the full and abſolute authority, which he hath obtained of the Father, he doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually defend us, and by his intervening in a manner keep off from us, the wrath of God, which is wont to be poured out upon the ungodly; which the Scripture expreſſeth, when it ſaith, that he intercedeth for us. Next, he delivereth us from the ſervitude of the ſins themſelves, whilſt by the ſame authority he withdraweth, and calleth us away from all kind of ſinnes, by ſhewing us in his own perſon, what he ſhall gain, who deſiſteth from ſinning; or elſe by exhorting, and warning, and helping, yea, ſometimes by puniſhing us.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> What is the difference between the expiation of the Old and New Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> That of the New, is more excellent, and that for two reaſons chiefly; firſt, in that the legall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:113294:84"/> extended onely to ſuch ſins as were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of ignorance, or weakneſſe: but for greater fins, which were manifeſt tranſgreſſions of the Law, no ſacrifices were appointed, but the penalty of death was propoſed. But if God did remit ſuch ſins to any one, that was not done by vertue of the Covenant, but by the ſingular Grace of God, which God beyond the Covenant exhibited when and to whom he liſted. But under the New Covenant, not only thoſe ſins are remitted, which have been acted through ignorance and weakneſſe, but ſuch as are the moſt open tranſgreſſions of the Law of God, ſo that he, who hath fallen in that manner, do not perſevere therein, but truly repent, and relapſe no more into ſuch ſins. Secondly, in that under the Old Covenant, the expiation of ſins was ſo made, as that the temporary puniſhment onely was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; whereas the New Covenant exhibites ſuch an expiation, as removeth not only the temporary, but the eternall penalties of ſins, and inſtead of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, offereth Eternall Life, promiſed in the Covenant, to thoſe whoſe ſins are expiated.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> How do you demonſtrate each of theſe?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> That the ſins which could not be expiated under the Old Covenant, may be expiated under the New, is teſtified by <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13. 38, 39. where he ſaith, Be it known unto you, brethren, that by this man is remiſſion of ſins declared to you. And from all things, wherefrom ye could not be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by Him every one that believeth is juſtified. The ſame may be ſeen, <hi>Rom</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. Now that ſins are in ſuch a manner expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the New Covenant, as that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall penalty of them is taken away, and Eternall Life given, appeareth from the laſt place we quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:113294:84"/> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. Where it is ſaid, That Chriſt by his own Bloud, entred once into the Sanctuary, having found Eternall Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> Why is that Sacrifice of Chriſt performed in the Heavens?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> Becauſe it required a Tabernacle ſuitable both to the Prieſt, and the Sacrifice. For ſince the Prieſt is immortall, and his Sacrifice alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incorruptible, it was neceſſary that he ſhould enter into an Eternall Tabernacle. But in as much as Heaven only is ſuch a Tabernacle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeat and habitation of God, and therefore it was neceſſary that he ſhould enter into the very Heaven, there to diſcharge his Prieſtly function, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> plainly teſtifieth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. and chap. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. and chap. 10. 5, 6, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q.</label> VVhat? was he not a Prieſt till he entred into the Heaven? not when he hung upon the Croſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> At no hand; for, as you heard even now, the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 8. 4. expreſly ſaith, that if Chriſt were upon the Earth, hee would not be a Prieſt. Beſides, for as much as the ſame Author, chap. 2. 17. teſtifieth, that Chriſt ought in all things to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mercifull and faithfull High-Prieſt to God ward, it is evident, that untill he had been made like unto his brethren in all things, that is, in afflictions and death, he was not out mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and faithfull High-Prieſt. Whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that his afflictions, and death were not his very Sacrifice, but a preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> Firſt, you muſt know that we doe not ſeparate the death of Chriſt, and exclude it from his offering, yea we conſtantly affirme that Chriſt no otherwiſe, then by his death, and the intervening thereof, offered himſelf. Onely we aſſert that his offering was not actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated and abſolved, till being raiſed from the dead, he paſſed into Heaven. For in that year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice under the Law, which chiefly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out the Sacrifice of Chriſt, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the work it was altogether neceſſary, that the bloud of the ſlain Beaſt ſhould be brought into the Sanctuary by the High-Prieſt, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7. Again, it is to be conſidered that the Apoſtle in the fore-mentioned place doth not ſay, that Chriſt offered himſelf to God for us. For this word [delivered] ought not to be joyned with the word [offering] but to be read by it ſelf, ſo that the ſenſe is, that Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered himſelf to death. For in that ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture elſewhere uſeth the word [de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.] Furthermore, the following words [a Sacrifice and offering to God for a ſweet-ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſavour] are an illuſtration and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that work of Chriſt in delivering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to death, (whereby the Apoſtle exhorteth the faithfull to imitate that deed of Chriſt in loving their neighbour.) As goods Works are in the like manner of ſpeaking, elſe where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18. And therefore doing of good, and communicating, are called Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, wherewith God is well-pleaſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.

               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> VVHat is the Viſible Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Society of ſuch Men, as hold and profeſſe the ſaving Truth. Which ſociety may be conſidered in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or in ſpeciall. In generall, when all the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Societies of Chriſt, diſperſed through the whole world, are conſidered as one Society of Chriſt, or one Church. In ſpeciall, when the particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, abiding in certain places, as taken for the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> For as much as now all Societies challenge to themſelves the name of the Church of Chriſt, I would fain hear whether there be any marks, whereby the Church of Chriſt may be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is to no great profit to inquire the Marks of a true Church of Chriſt, ſince I have declared to you what conſtituteth a True Church, namely
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:113294:86"/> the ſaving Truth, which whatſoever Society hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and profeſſeth, is a true Church of Chriſt. But ſuch a Society as holdeth not the ſaving Truth, or Doctrine, nor profeſſeth it not, although it make ſhew of I know not what ſignes, yet can it not be accounted a true Church of Chriſt. But to hold the ſaving Doctrine, ſince it is the eſſence of the Church of Chriſt, cannot, if we ſpeak properly, be the Mark thereof, ſince the ſigne ought to differ from the thing whereof it is the ſigne.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Therefore to know which is the true Church of Chriſt, it is ſufficient to know the ſaving Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> You rightly apprehend the thing. For he that embraceth the ſaving Doctrine, is already in the true Church. So that he hath no need to enquire the notes of a true Church, whereby it may be known. But what the ſaving doctrine is, you may underſtand by our foregoing ſpeech, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That order conſiſteth in the duties of thoſe perſons, whereof the Church conſiſteth, and the diligent and accurate care, that all the perſons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their ſeverall duties.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As to the Apoſtles and Prophets, it is certain that they have no more place in the Church of Chriſt. For the cauſe for which they were choſen and ſent forth by the Lord, is now ceaſed; which was, that God by them would have the doctrine of his Son declared and confirmed to the world. And therefore they were called the foundations of the Church of Chriſt by <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. Wherefore, after that the Goſpell of Chriſt had, according to the counſell of God, been abundantly diſcovered to the world, and confirmed, there is no more place left in the Church for ſuch perſons as ſhould any further diſcover, and confirm the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>Why call you the Apoſtles and Prophets the foundation of the Church, when Chriſt himſelf is the foundation thereof?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 11.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:113294:88"/>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Apoſtles and Prophets are called the foundation of the Church in one ſenſe, and Chriſt is in another the foundation thereof. The one, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reference to other men, who belong to the ſame Church of Chriſt, and wholly ground themſelves on the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and Prophets. And then Chriſt is conſidered as ſomething greater, that is, as the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of that foundation, ſee the forecited place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. The other, not onely in reference to the reſt of the Church, but alſo the very Apoſtles themſelves, who are built upon Chriſt, as well as other Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What ſay you concerning Evangeliſts?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> That they ceaſed together with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For they did then with the Apoſtles preach a New doctrine, which now accounted moſt Old.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> What think you of the other perſons?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> In as much as their Miniſtries doe even now continue, the perſons themſelves muſt alſo needs continue, as being conſtituted for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How are they conſtituted for the Ministry?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As we have it ſet down in the doctrine of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How is that?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> Concerning the offices of Doctors, Paſtors, Biſhops, and Presbyters, or Elders, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> at large diſcovereth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Biſhop muſt be unblameable, &amp;c. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 6, 7. &amp;c. A Biſhop muſt be unreproveable, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> Have not thoſe who teach in the Church, and keep order therein, need to be ſent in ſome ſpeciall manner?</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:113294:88"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> By no means; for they doe not now bring a new doctrine, and ſuch as was unheard of before, but that of the Apoſtles, received of old by all men, exhorting men to lead their lives according to it. Whence the Apoſtle expreſly deſcribing all things, which belong to the conſtituting of ſuch perſons, make no mention of any miſſion or ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nevertheleſſe when ſuch perſons according to the preſcript of the Apoſtolick Doctrine are conſtituted, and are endued with thoſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, namely innocency of life, and aptneſſe to teach, they ought thereupon to have juſt authority amongſt all.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> 
                  <hi>What ſay you to thoſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> Rom. 10. 15. <hi>How ſhall they preach, unleſſe they be ſent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> The Apoſtle doth not here ſpeak of any preaching whatſoever, but of the preaching of a new Doctrine, and ſuch as hath not formerly been heard, of which ſort was the preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their aſſiſtants, who therefore had need of a miſſion, or ſending. But in as much as at this day there is no ſuch preaching, there is alſo no need of ſuch a miſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> How ought Deacons to be ordained?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> As the Apoſtles directed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8, 9. Let the Deacons in like manner be grave, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Q.</label> You have handled what pertained to thoſe that govern, now handle alſo that which pertaineth to thoſe that are governed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is their duty to be obedient unto thoſe that govern, in all thoſe things, which they preſcribe according to the Word of God. Concerning which we read in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> chap. 13. 17. Next, that they communicate to them that teach
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:113294:89"/> in all good things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. yea, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them double honour, or maintenance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Finally, that an accuſation againſt them be not admitted under two or three Witneſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19.</p>

Even this, that being caſt out of the Church, and conſequently out of the Kingdom of Chriſt, there remaineth nothing for them, nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſince this Excommunication is no other then that binding whereof Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18.

                  <label>Q.</label> What is the power of binding and looſing which the Church hath?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A.</label> It is the declaring and denouncing according to the Word of God, who is unworthy to be of the Church of Chriſt.</p>

And the Lord God give you his aſſiſtance thereunto, to whom, in as much as he hath been pleaſed graciouſly to help us in bringing this Conference to an end, be praiſe and glory, through Jeſus Chriſt, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
